A new color picker. And the all-HiDPI (retina) dashboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Keyboard navigation and screen reader support have both been improved.</li>\n<li><strong>Plugins: </strong>You can browse and install plugins you&#8217;ve marked as favorites on WordPress.org, directly from your dashboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Mobile: </strong>It&#8217;ll be easier to link up your WordPress install with <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/mobile/">our mobile apps</a>, as XML-RPC is now enabled by default.</li>\n<li><strong>Links: </strong>We&#8217;ve hidden the Link Manager for new installs. (Don&#8217;t worry, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/link-manager/">there&#8217;s a plugin for that</a>.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Developers: </strong>We love you. We do. And one of the things we strive to do with every release is be compatible with all existing plugins and themes. To make sure we don&#8217;t break anything, we need your help. <strong>Please, please test your plugins and themes against 3.5.</strong> If something isn&#8217;t quite right, please let us know. (Chances are, it wasn&#8217;t intentional.) And despite all of the changes to media, we&#8217;re still aiming to be backwards compatible with plugins that make changes to the existing media library. It&#8217;s a tall task, and it means we need your help.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some more things we think developers will enjoy (and should test their plugins and themes against):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>External libraries updated:</strong> TinyMCE  3.5.6. SimplePie 1.3. jQuery 1.8.2. jQuery UI 1.9 (and it&#8217;s not even released yet). We&#8217;ve also added Backbone 0.9.2 and Underscore 1.3.3, and you can use protocol-relative links when enqueueing scripts and styles. (<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16560">#16560</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>WP Query:</strong> You can now ask to receive posts in the order specified by <code>post__in</code>. (<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13729">#13729</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>XML-RPC:</strong> New user management, profile editing, and post revision methods.

Also: You can now use multisite in a subdirectory, and uploaded files no longer go through ms-files (for new installs). (<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21434">#21434</a>, <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19796">#19796</a>, <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19235">#19235</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>TinyMCE: </strong>We&#8217;ve added API support for &#8220;views&#8221; which you can use to offer previews and interaction of elements from the visual editor. (<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21812">#21812</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Posts API: </strong>Major performance improvements when working with hierarchies of pages and post ancestors. Also, you can now &#8220;turn on&#8221; native custom columns for taxonomies on edit post screens. (<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11399">#11399</a>, <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21309">#21309</a>, <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21240">#21240</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Comments API:</strong> Search for comments of a particular status, or with a meta query (same as with WP_Query). (<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21101">#21101</a>, <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21003">#21003</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>oEmbed: </strong>We&#8217;ve added support for a few oEmbed providers, and we now handle SSL links.

If you break it (find a bug), please report it, and if you’re a developer, try to help us fix it. We&#8217;ve already had more than 200 contributors to version 3.5 — come join us!</p>\n<h3>And as promised, a bonus:</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;re planning a December 5 release for WordPress 3.5. But, we have a special offering for you, today.

Though there are hundreds of people around the globe organizing WordCamps, WordPress meetups, hackathons, free classes and the like, since their &#8220;projects&#8221; were all happening locally there was never a central hub of activity for these folks. Despite the many informal connections between community organizers, we weren&#8217;t taking advantage of the huge existing knowledge base as new organizers stepped up to the plate.</p>\n<p>With the creation of <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/events/">this new contributor group</a>, we finally have a way to organize and recognize these kinds of contributions, a clear avenue for feedback and input when it comes to policies around official events, and the opportunity to create even more connections between community organizers through mentorship programs and group projects. I&#8217;m especially excited about the creation of this group because until now the role of community organizer, while one of the most important, has not gotten the same recognition as higher-profile contribution methods such as forum support or core code contribution. That is something I hope this group will change, and the local organizers can be recognized for the community leaders they are.*</p>\n<p>If you are the organizer of a local WordCamp, WordPress meetup, etc., head over to <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/events/">http://make.wordpress.org/events/</a> and introduce yourself so we can include you in the fun!</p>\n<p>Speaking of meetups, an update on <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/year-of-the-meetup/">my last post about meetups</a> is long overdue. With around 500 meetup organizers (and/or potential organizers) responding to my last survey, it took much longer than anticipated to review all the responses. We&#8217;re working now with meetup.com to issue invitations to join a centralized WordPress Meetup account, so if you filled out the form earlier this year, you should be hearing from them soon. The first wave of existing meetup account transfers (for those who opted in) should happen in the next two weeks, with additional waves every 3 months thereafter (and new groups will be able to be created along the way).</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/05/calling-all-contributors-community-summit-2012/">contributor summit</a> that is being planned for the end of October also generated hundreds of responses/nominations, so that review process is still happening, but we should be announcing some basic plans and issuing invitations soon.</p>\n<p>And finally, it would be impossible to talk about in-person WordPress events without mentioning the upcoming annual <a href="http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org">WordCamp in San Francisco</a>. As the event that represents the worldwide project as a whole, it&#8217;s the perfect time to evaluate where we stand as a project and as a community, to help determine where we go next. If you&#8217;re a WordPress user, developer, or in any way a part of our vast and interconnected ecosystem, please take a moment to fill in the <a href="http://wpsurvey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2012">2nd annual WordPress survey</a>. It&#8217;s just a couple of questions, and your input would be greatly appreciated. The results of the survey will be announced at <a href="http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org">WSCF</a>, and a report issued shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>*<em> I am also of the firm belief that academic and arts activities should earn varsity letters just like sports teams do &#8212; go mathletes! </em></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/07/event-organizers-unite/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:45:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"WordPress 3.4.1 Maintenance and Security Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/wordpress-3-4-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/wordpress-3-4-1/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:57:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Security";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2383";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:379:"WordPress 3.4.1 is now available for download.

We&#8217;ve dubbed this release &#8220;Green&#8221; in honor of guitarist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Green">Grant Green</a> whose soulful simplicity has kept many of us company during this release.</p>\n<p>This release includes significant improvements to theme customization, custom headers, Twitter embeds, and image captions &#8212; here&#8217;s a short clip with the highlights:</p>\n<div id="v-Gg0EFixV-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-Gg0EFixV-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=Gg0EFixV&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="692" height="388" title="Introducing WordPress 3.4 &quot;Green&quot;" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Users</h3>\n<p>The biggest change in 3.4 is the <strong>theme customizer</strong> which allows you to play around with various looks and settings for your current theme or one you&#8217;re thinking about switching to without publishing those changes to the whole world. For themes that support it, you can change colors, backgrounds, and of course custom image headers. We have more planned for the customizer down the road.</p>\n<p>Throughout the rest of the admin you&#8217;ll notice tweaks to make your everyday life easier. For example, if you have lots of themes we&#8217;ve made it quicker to browse them all at once without paging. We&#8217;ve made it possible to use images from your media library to populate custom headers, and for you to choose the height and width of your header images.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve expanded our embed support to include tweets: just put a Twitter permalink on its own line in the post editor and we&#8217;ll turn it into a beautiful embedded Tweet. And finally, image captions have been improved to allow HTML, like links, in them.</p>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>There are hundreds of under-the-hood improvements in this release, notably in the XML-RPC, themes, and custom header APIs, and significant performance improvements in WP_Query and the translation system. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.4">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features</a>, and you can always <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.4">dive into Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also <a href="http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/wordpress-3-4-field-guide-for-developers/">put together a busy developer&#8217;s field guide to the new APIs in 3.4</a>.</p>\n<h3>It takes a village</h3>\n<p>Here are some of the fine folks who were involved in bringing 3.4 to the world:</p>\n<p><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/082net">082net</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell">Aaron D.

There are over <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">19,000 plugins listed</a> and they&#8217;re really the heart and soul of WordPress for many people, so they deserve a little tender loving care. Here&#8217;s a quick before and after snapshot you can zoom in on to see a visual overview of some of the changes:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/contact-form-7.png"><img src="http://s2.wp.com/imgpress?resize=690,350&amp;url=http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/contact-form-7.png&amp;unsharpmask=80,0.5,3" alt="" /></a></p>\n<p>Our first focus was around improving the discussion and support around plugins.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll now notice that threads about a plugin are pulled directly into a &#8220;support&#8221; tab on the plugin page &#8212; each plugin has its own forum. We&#8217;ve made authors much more prominent and with bigger Gravatars and better placement, so you can get a sense of who made the plugin you&#8217;re using. And finally to show how active and well-supported a plugin is, you can see  &#8221;16 of 75 support threads in the last two weeks have been resolved.&#8221; Finally, if you&#8217;re logged in you get access to the new &#8220;favorites&#8221; feature that lets you mark the plugins you use the most so you can share them on your profile page and find them quickly later. We soft-launched favorites a few days ago and there have already been 2,000 saved!</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a plugin author, we&#8217;ve started with a short threshold (2 weeks) for the resolved stats so it&#8217;s easy to catch up and stay on top of it. (It&#8217;ll eventually go to two months.) You also now have the ability to set stickies on your plugin forum to put FAQs or important information at the top, and of course any person you put as a committer on the plugin will have moderation access. People on the forum tag will see your custom header and links to the other resources attached to your plugin.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve tightened up the styling a bit on the forums and plugin pages, though still some cleanups to do there. Some older improvements you might have missed, but are still useful for users and developers alike:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Plugin headers&#8221; or those cool graphics you see at the top of plugin pages have really taken off, there are over 1,600 active now.</li>\n<li>You can now subscribe to get an email whenever a commit is made to a plugin repository even if it isn&#8217;t yours. There is no better way to follow the development of your favorite plugins. There&#8217;s nothing like the smell of fresh changesets in the morning.</li>\n<li>Behind the scenes, we&#8217;ve dramatically ramped up proactive scanning of the entire repository to help authors fix security and other problems they might not even know about yet. The quality level of the repo has gone way, way up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this will continue to evolve as we get feedback and see usage, but we&#8217;re happy to have been able to make some key improvements in just a few days while hanging out in Memphis. (This is why WordCamps usually have BBQ &#8212; it imparts magical coding powers.)</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/05/plugins-refreshed/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:4:"href";s:31:"http://wordpress.org/news/feed/";s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:44:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/";a:2:{s:12:"updatePeriod";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"hourly";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:15:"updateFrequency";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:8:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Fri, 02 Nov 2012 17:45:13 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:23:"text/xml; charset=UTF-8";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:10:"x-pingback";s:36:"http://wordpress.org/news/xmlrpc.php";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Sat, 13 Oct 2012 00:02:08 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT luv 138";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20111015034325";}', 'no');

Now, if you wish to rate a plugin or a theme, you must also describe your rating decision in a brief review. The goal is that developers will hopefully be left with usable feedback to turn around 1-star ratings or feedback to carry over to their next project from the 5-star ratings, and potential users will be able to clearly see whether the reasons for a plugin or theme&#8217;s particular 1-star rating really has any impact on what they plan to use it for.</p>\n<p>You can take a look at some sample ratings now by visiting the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/hotfix">Hotfix</a> plugin and the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/view/theme-reviews/twentytwelve">Twenty Twelve</a> theme. So, what you waiting for? Get out there and leave some reviews for your favorite plugins!</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/fAMy_jzoF-I" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 02 Nov 2012 14:30:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"James";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"WordPress.tv: Vasil Kolev: What the Programmers Don’t Know and I Wish They Did";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=14091";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"http://wordpress.tv/2012/11/02/vasil-kolev-what-the-programmers-dont-know-and-i-wish-they-did/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:711:"<div id="v-joj1izpX-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/14091/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/14091/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=14091&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2012/11/02/vasil-kolev-what-the-programmers-dont-know-and-i-wish-they-did/"><img alt="Vasil Kolev: What the Programmers Don&#8217;t Know and I Wish They Did" src="http://videos.videopress.com/joj1izpX/video-9dd77512b8_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 02 Nov 2012 13:16:42 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Matt: Presidential Endorsements";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=41973";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"http://ma.tt/2012/11/presidential-endorsements/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:882:"<p>It&#8217;s interesting to read the contrast between the presidential endorsements (for Obama) from two of my favorite magazines, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2012/10/29/121029taco_talk_editors">the New Yorker</a> and <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21565623-america-could-do-better-barack-obama-sadly-mitt-romney-does-not-fit-bill-which-one?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/which_one_">Economist</a>. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-01/a-vote-for-a-president-to-lead-on-climate-change.html">Mayor Bloomberg was also a surprise</a>.

a WordPress blog, you have a variety of tools to not only create content, but to share it and get your newest, freshest stuff out to your audience quickly. <a href="http://pingomatic.com/">Ping-O-Matic</a> is a quick and simple way to let others know you’ve posted new content—and ultimately drive more traffic to your blog. For self-hosted WordPress blogs, this update service is <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Update_Services">a built-in feature</a>; you can choose the update services you would like to &#8220;ping&#8221; by going to Settings &gt; Writing in your dashboard.</p>\n<p>Need a refresher or primer? As you fill in your blog details at <a href="http://pingomatic.com/">Ping-O-Matic</a>,  you can opt to ping multiple ping servers at once, such as Weblogs.com, NewsGator, Blo.gs, and FeedBurner. When you ping these services, they automatically notify subscribers that new content is posted to your website or blog.</p>\n<p>Essentially, Ping-O-Matic is a service that notifies the larger community—from search engines and blogging platforms to aggregators and social networks—of the newest, freshest content on the Internet. This, in turn, helps improve the speed at which search engines find and index <em>your</em> content.</p>\n<p>That said, driving traffic to your blog isn&#8217;t simply about enabling this service and letting it do all the work for you. Remember that getting more traffic requires more effort—posting well-written, original content in particular.</p>\n<p>To get you started, we want you to stir things up on your blog and write about a topic that&#8217;s up for debate. At <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/">The Daily Post</a>, we post Mind the Gap prompts that ask readers what they think about controversial and divisive issues. <strong><em>So, we’re particularly interested in what you think about kids in adult-oriented places.</em> </strong>Most of us can agree that it’s not a good idea to drag little Sally to a bar at 1AM, but what about a museum? A fancy restaurant?</p>\n<h2>Here are the essentials to consider when drafting this post:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read up on the <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/weekly-writing-challenge-children/">existing discussion</a> of this topic: </strong>Researching this topic (and any other subject you tackle) beforehand strengthens your own stance. And it also allows you to link to related posts that enhance your discussion, as well as engage with other bloggers who have weighed in on the topic. Both are good practices and additional ways to drive the right kind of traffic to your site.</li>\n<li><strong>Pick a good, relevant title: </strong>Blog post titles are like newspaper headlines. They need to be short, snappy, and attention-grabbing. On social networks like Facebook and Twitter, your title is the primary (and may be the only) text that readers see before clicking to your post.</li>\n<li><strong><strong>Edit, proofread, and proofread some more: </strong></strong>Take the time to develop your ideas. Readers are smart—they prefer to read posts that intrigue them, make them think and question, and rouse them up. If you pique their interest, they will comment on your post thoughtfully in return.</li>\n<li><strong>Generate your own discussion: </strong>After presenting your thoughts on kids in adult-oriented places, ask questions or create your own poll at the end of your post to prompt your readers.</li>\n<li><strong>Share your stuff on social networks: </strong>Use the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins">sharing tools available to you</a> to share this post across the Internet. Make it easy for others to spread the word.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can apply the process above to other posts you write. Overall, it&#8217;s important to remember that original, relevant, and well-written content is key, and from there you can share it and use the tools and services available to you to draw traffic to your blog.</p>\n<p>We look forward to providing more tips on this blog. Stay tuned!</p>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/pingomatic.wordpress.com/50/"><img alt="" border="0"

(hopefully, the first of many) &#8212; a by-invitation event bringing together a diversity of voices from the WordPress community, with the approximately 100 attendees nominated and selected by the community itself. The event had an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a> format.</p>\n<p>In the morning, we proposed topics for discussion (about half or more of the attendees championed topics). We then found areas where topics overlapped, and combined similar ones, so that we ended up with about 35-40 separate topics. These were then spread out through the day, broken into four 45 minute time slots (two morning sessions, two afternoon sessions), with about 8-10 simultaneous discussions per session. The day rounded out with a general Q&amp;A session and an all-inclusive discussion, led by Matt Mullenweg, which challenged us all to think really hard about the changes occurring in the web landscape, which WordPress must keep up with in order to remain relevant.</p>\n<p>Discussions I participated in were</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Theme review team, led by Chip Bennett</li>\n<li>WordPress Codex, led by Andrea Rennick (which included my proposed topic on Best Practices documentation)</li>\n<li>Pain-points of switching themes, led by Michael Fields</li>\n<li>&#8220;JavaScript with Koop&#8221;, led by Daryl Koopersmith</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There were many other topics discussed, and I wish I could have cloned myself and listened in on many more. There were discussions on security, community participation by commercial development shops, internationalization and translation, automatic updates, licensing, and tons of other things.</p>\n<p>Right now, my brain is still aswirl with ideas and things I want to work on. I just need to find the time. Over the next few days and weeks, we will be seeing the details and action item results of all this, and I hope that you all will be able to enjoy the fruits of these discussions very soon.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s so much more I&#8217;d like to say, but it&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m tired, and I&#8217;m still absorbing everything&#8230;</p>\n<p>Original Article: <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2012/10/30/wordpress-community-summit-brain-overload/">WordPress Community Summit: Brain Overload</a>\n<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org">Dougal Campbell&#039;s geek ramblings - WordPress, web development, and world domination.</a></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 04:11:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Dougal Campbell";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"Weblog Tools Collection: Updated WordPress Theme Tutorial Underway";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=12161";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/VMIuzFy6_Pk/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:981:"<p><a href="http://themeshaper.com/">ThemeShaper</a> is working on bringing their popular <a href="http://themeshaper.com/2012/10/22/the-themeshaper-wordpress-theme-tutorial-2nd-edition/">WordPress Theme Tutorial</a> up to modern-day standards and techniques.

Looks like the timing is excellent.</p>\n<p><img src="http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/weather.png" alt="" title="weather" width="480" height="286" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14882" /></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 21:41:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Alex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Theme Releases for 10/24";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=12139";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/M-5uLssoaSs/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1484:"<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12142" title="harmoni" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/harmoni.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="113" /></p>\n<p><a href="http://arifqodari.co.de/features/"><strong>Harmoni</strong></a> is a simple and clean theme with a responsive layout.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12140" title="neutral" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/neutral.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="113" /></p>\n<p><a href="http://emptynestthemes.com/2012/10/23/neutral-wordpress-blog-theme/"><strong>Neutral</strong></a> is a professional looking and attractive theme that lives up to its name, with a neutral color scheme that includes taupe or beige, white and gray with a very readable and clean sans serif font for the main body text, and an attractive script for the headings to add just a touch of personality.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12141" title="stripefolio" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/stripefolio.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="113" /></p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/stripefolio"><strong>Stripefolio</strong></a> is a free clean theme designed to function both as a readable blog and website as well as a fullscreen portfolio showcase for designers, painters, artists, photographers, etc.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/M-5uLssoaSs" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 14:45:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"James";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"Alex King: 2012 WordCamp Denver Presentation";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://alexking.org/?p=14857";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"http://alexking.org/blog/2012/10/23/2012-wordcamp-denver-presentation";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1552:"<p>I just realized I never posted a link to my slides from my <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2012/10/09/wordcamp-denver-this-weekend">WordCamp Denver</a> presentation a few weeks back.</p>\n<p>You can find them here: <a href="http://alexking.org/speaking/core-competency/index.php">Core Competency</a></p>\n<p>Navigate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>between slides using the LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys</li>\n<li>&#8220;within&#8221; a slide using the UP/DOWN arrow keys (red bottom corner indicator)</li>\n<li>N or ] = jump to next section</li>\n<li>P or [ = jump to previous section</li>\n<li>1 = go to beginning</li>\n<li>0 = go to end</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Curious about the code?

Read on to learn what&#8217;s new, and then update/download version 3.2 of the app from the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8">App Store.</a></p>\n<h3>Featured Images Support</h3>\n<p>This has been one of our most requested features for some time. We&#8217;re happy to report that you can now upload a Featured Image for your blog posts as long as your theme supports it. You&#8217;ll find the Featured Image uploader in the Settings section of the Post Editor—see the screenshot on the right.</p>\n<p>You can upload a Featured Image of any size, but by default it&#8217;ll use the Image Size preference, which you&#8217;ll now find in the Settings section within the app (more on this below).</p>\n<h3>Push Notifications for Self-Hosted Websites</h3>\n<p>Push Notifications are now available for self-hosted blogs running Jetpack 1.8.2 or higher. To make it work, we had to have a central server to deliver the notifications to your device, so this feature requires the <a href="http://jetpack.me">Jetpack plugin by Automattic</a> to function. Push notifications for self-hosted blogs will work just like how they currently work for WordPress.com-hosted blogs: you get push notifications for new comments only, and will be directed to the comment within the app if you choose to view the notification.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/wpios-3-2-self-hosted-push-notifications2.png"><img src="http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/wpios-3-2-self-hosted-push-notifications2.png?w=300&h=146" alt="Version 3.2 of WordPress for iOS: Self-Hosted Push Notifications" title="Version 3.2 of WordPress for iOS: Self-Hosted Push Notifications" width="300" height="146" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1286" /></a></p>\n<p>Note: only the owner of the blog will receive push notifications for new comments on their own posts. We are working on making push notifications available for all authors on a blog in version 1.9 of Jetpack. This version is currently in Beta and will be released within a few weeks.</p>\n<h3><a href="http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/wpios-3-2-accessible-settings.jpg"><img src="http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/wpios-3-2-accessible-settings.jpg?w=240&h=517" alt="Version 3.2 of WordPress for iOS: More Accessible Settings" title="Version 3.2 of WordPress for iOS: More Accessible Settings" width="240" height="517" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1269" /></a>More Accessible Settings</h3>\n<p>As a part of this update, we&#8217;ve moved all the preferences previously only available in the Settings app on your device to the Settings screen within the app itself. This makes it much easier to change settings on the fly. You may even find settings that you didn&#8217;t knew were already available in the app. Moving forward, we&#8217;ll make sure all settings are available right within the app.</p>\n<h3>Stability Improvements</h3>\n<p>In addition to the new features, we&#8217;ve worked hard on making the app even more stable. In total, <a href="http://ios.trac.wordpress.org/query?group=status&milestone=3.2">almost 70 bugs and crashes have been fixed</a> in this release. We&#8217;ve also worked hard on making the Stats section of the app perform better.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s Next</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;re moving to a more feature-driven release cycle, meaning that updates will come faster and focus on single features and enhancements. This is the perfect time to get involved in the WordPress for iOS project.

Before I left MICA I was awarded the honor of "Excellence in Social Design." For many graphic designers, "Social Design" is a term that is used quite often without ever specifically being defined. We all know what we mean when we say "Social Designer," right? As I stood in MICA''s design department auditorium – receiving the kind words of my professors, a flower necklace, and a copy of Cradle to Cradle – I couldn''t help but wonder, "what exactly does it mean and what are its implications?"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBefore my senior year at MICA, I had the opportunity to work for John Bielenberg in Greensboro, Alabama. There, I co-directed the M Lab with my partner, Megan Deal. M Lab was the permanent manifestation of Project M, an annual month long workshop in which designers and other creatives apply their talents to "saving the world." Our job – which was never actually perfectly clear – involved being a youthful creative resource in a small rural town. I was optimistic, but struggled to imagine how graphic design could help.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter my first few months, I was approached by Tom Callos of the Ultimate Black Belt Test. He explained the UBBT; an annual group of karate black belt volunteers traveling to Greensboro to build a home for a resident in need. He then asked me to help them raise donations and awareness for their 2011 build. Finally, after months of trying to think of a "project" that could help Greensboro, reality had struck – people were already doing amazing things for the town and they needed graphic design. The website I built for Tom eventually raised over $16,000, and while obviously my website wasn''t the sole reason for those donations, it felt good to know that I had helped.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn December, my sixth month living, working, and cycling in Greensboro, a young man asked me and my friend, Dan Gavin, where we got our bikes. The idea for BikeLab suddenly hit me. Hale County – of which Greensboro is the county seat – is one of the poorest in the nation and many of its citizens lack access to transportation. Hale County also happens to have very little car traffic, is relatively flat, and spread out just enough to make walking impractical; basically, it is perfect for bicycling. With the advice of several other bicycle co-ops and Dan''s maintenance skills, we founded BikeLab as a non-profit under Hero Housing (a local housing resource center) to begin to address this issue. Within the next six months we had helped three local youths build their own bikes out of donated parts – admittedly a small impact, but a measurable one.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter M Lab, I re-enrolled at MICA to finish my senior year. REBU!LD, my thesis, began after a walk through West Baltimore. Surrounded on either side by abandoned rowhomes, I found myself on what seemed to be an entirely empty block. However, as I continued, I noticed a child on the opposite side of the street stop in front of one of the homes. I suddenly realized that he lived there, on a block that was otherwise completely vacant and crumbling. Soon after, I learned of "New East Baltimore," and came to find that the 88-acre redevelopment was not too different from the block I had visited in the west. However here, the causes for displacement were much more obvious. For four months, I documented the redevelopment, through audio interviews – with residents (current and former), development employees, and local activists – and photography.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNot that I thought it could directly help the boy or one in his position, REBU!LD took the form of a website and an installation. For the website, I compiled both my audio and photographs to create a narrative to tell the story of the redevelopment. For the installation, which took place within the development footprint, I wheatpasted large-format photographs onto the boarded façades of an entirely vacant block. The installation and subsequent opening was meant to celebrate the remaining community, invite people to see the footprint for themselves, and provide a poignant contrast to the crumbling buildings my photographs appeared on.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand it, any one of these projects could be considered "social design"; they typify criteria like working with ethical clientele and design entrepreneurship. However, I can''t help but wonder why such a distinction is necessary, why shouldn''t these criteria be implicit in every graphic designer''s practice? This is not to say that graphic design is devoid of such projects or that they are completely unique. I can happily say that work like this is becoming more and more common. The website I completed for the UBBT is an example of working with an ethical organization and was a chance to utilize my skill set to complement and augment their good work. Designers like Silas Munro, the design director at the non-profit Housing Works, exemplify this idea by working in a sector where graphic design can rarely be afforded. The founding of BikeLab and REBU!LD represent examples of design entrepreneurship; first-hand experience, research, and most importantly, multi-disciplinary collaboration made their success possible. BikeLab could easily have been a Brute Labs project, where ideas are founded on extensive research into social ills and then funded by generous donors (grants and awards). REBU!LD, though it may be harder to classify under this criterion, is not unlike the work of The Center for Urban Pedagogy where graphic design, utilizing research and collaboration, decodes our urban environment and solicits participation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBy labeling these kinds of efforts as part of an emerging field called "social design", one that increasingly requires a Master''s degree, do we risk deterring "non-social designers" from pursuing similar efforts? By lumping the diverse approaches by graphic designers, architects, artists, computer developers etc… towards social good into a single "job" are we fostering an oxymoronic profession; a specialized jack-of-all-trades? Furthermore, in a world where the "triple bottom line" is rightly gaining momentum and the "greater good" is recognized as the common good, could "social design" be an oversimplification for young creatives working towards a future that requires collaboration and optimism?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="Photo1" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bd5Nkd6WB2E/Tou_Kx6SOcI/AAAAAAAAAEo/G1206eoMcLI/s320/rlecluyse_ubbt.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="179" />\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="photo2" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rfFtVRsjan0/Tou_KmszGuI/AAAAAAAAAEg/xM0q1lqDgNM/s320/rlecluyse_rb.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="179" />\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="photo3" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dngY9suQrd8/Tou_KofjyLI/AAAAAAAAAEY/6_UdwZ5nbR8/s320/rlecluyse_in_2.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="212" />\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="photo5" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M74EcjcPONk/Tou_KUaAwcI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/sd8i_XcCesc/s1600/rlecluyse_in_1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="794" />', 'What is Social Design?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'what-is-social-design', '', '', '2012-11-01 17:51:06', '2012-11-01 17:51:06', '', 0, 'http://localhost:8888/?p=196', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The idea for BikeLab suddenly hit me. Hale County – of which Greensboro is the county seat – is one of the poorest in the nation and many of its citizens lack access to transportation. Hale County also happens to have very little car traffic, is relatively flat, and spread out just enough to make walking impractical; basically, it is perfect for bicycling. With the advice of several other bicycle co-ops and Dan''s maintenance skills, we founded BikeLab as a non-profit under Hero Housing (a local housing resource center) to begin to address this issue. Within the next six months we had helped three local youths build their own bikes out of donated parts – admittedly a small impact, but a measurable one.\r\n\r\nAfter M Lab, I re-enrolled at MICA to finish my senior year. REBU!LD, my thesis, began after a walk through West Baltimore. Surrounded on either side by abandoned rowhomes, I found myself on what seemed to be an entirely empty block. However, as I continued, I noticed a child on the opposite side of the street stop in front of one of the homes. I suddenly realized that he lived there, on a block that was otherwise completely vacant and crumbling. Soon after, I learned of "New East Baltimore," and came to find that the 88-acre redevelopment was not too different from the block I had visited in the west. However here, the causes for displacement were much more obvious. For four months, I documented the redevelopment, through audio interviews – with residents (current and former), development employees, and local activists – and photography.\r\n\r\nNot that I thought it could directly help the boy or one in his position, REBU!LD took the form of a website and an installation. For the website, I compiled both my audio and photographs to create a narrative to tell the story of the redevelopment. For the installation, which took place within the development footprint, I wheatpasted large-format photographs onto the boarded façades of an entirely vacant block. The installation and subsequent opening was meant to celebrate the remaining community, invite people to see the footprint for themselves, and provide a poignant contrast to the crumbling buildings my photographs appeared on.\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand it, any one of these projects could be considered "social design"; they typify criteria like working with ethical clientele and design entrepreneurship. However, I can''t help but wonder why such a distinction is necessary, why shouldn''t these criteria be implicit in every graphic designer''s practice? This is not to say that graphic design is devoid of such projects or that they are completely unique. I can happily say that work like this is becoming more and more common. The website I completed for the UBBT is an example of working with an ethical organization and was a chance to utilize my skill set to complement and augment their good work. Designers like Silas Munro, the design director at the non-profit Housing Works, exemplify this idea by working in a sector where graphic design can rarely be afforded. The founding of BikeLab and REBU!LD represent examples of design entrepreneurship; first-hand experience, research, and most importantly, multi-disciplinary collaboration made their success possible. BikeLab could easily have been a Brute Labs project, where ideas are founded on extensive research into social ills and then funded by generous donors (grants and awards). REBU!LD, though it may be harder to classify under this criterion, is not unlike the work of The Center for Urban Pedagogy where graphic design, utilizing research and collaboration, decodes our urban environment and solicits participation.\r\n\r\nBy labeling these kinds of efforts as part of an emerging field called "social design", one that increasingly requires a Master''s degree, do we risk deterring "non-social designers" from pursuing similar efforts? By lumping the diverse approaches by graphic designers, architects, artists, computer developers etc… towards social good into a single "job" are we fostering an oxymoronic profession; a specialized jack-of-all-trades? Furthermore, in a world where the "triple bottom line" is rightly gaining momentum and the "greater good" is recognized as the common good, could "social design" be an oversimplification for young creatives working towards a future that requires collaboration and optimism?\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="Photo1" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bd5Nkd6WB2E/Tou_Kx6SOcI/AAAAAAAAAEo/G1206eoMcLI/s320/rlecluyse_ubbt.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="179" />\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="photo2" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rfFtVRsjan0/Tou_KmszGuI/AAAAAAAAAEg/xM0q1lqDgNM/s320/rlecluyse_rb.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="179" />\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="photo3" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dngY9suQrd8/Tou_KofjyLI/AAAAAAAAAEY/6_UdwZ5nbR8/s320/rlecluyse_in_2.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="212" />\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="photo5" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M74EcjcPONk/Tou_KUaAwcI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/sd8i_XcCesc/s1600/rlecluyse_in_1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="794" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'What is Social Design?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '196-revision-3', '', '', '2012-10-31 01:58:55', '2012-10-31 01:58:55', '', 196, 'http://localhost:8888/2012/10/196-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(206, 1, '2012-10-31 02:54:25', '2012-10-31 02:54:25', 'I graduated this past May from the Maryland Institute College of Art with a degree in Graphic Design. Before I left MICA I was awarded the honor of "Excellence in Social Design." For many graphic designers, "Social Design" is a term that is used quite often without ever specifically being defined. We all know what we mean when we say "Social Designer," right? As I stood in MICA''s design department auditorium – receiving the kind words of my professors, a flower necklace, and a copy of Cradle to Cradle – I couldn''t help but wonder, "what exactly does it mean and what are its implications?"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBefore my senior year at MICA, I had the opportunity to work for John Bielenberg in Greensboro, Alabama. There, I co-directed the M Lab with my partner, Megan Deal. M Lab was the permanent manifestation of Project M, an annual month long workshop in which designers and other creatives apply their talents to "saving the world." Our job – which was never actually perfectly clear – involved being a youthful creative resource in a small rural town. I was optimistic, but struggled to imagine how graphic design could help.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter my first few months, I was approached by Tom Callos of the Ultimate Black Belt Test. He explained the UBBT; an annual group of karate black belt volunteers traveling to Greensboro to build a home for a resident in need. He then asked me to help them raise donations and awareness for their 2011 build. Finally, after months of trying to think of a "project" that could help Greensboro, reality had struck – people were already doing amazing things for the town and they needed graphic design. The website I built for Tom eventually raised over $16,000, and while obviously my website wasn''t the sole reason for those donations, it felt good to know that I had helped.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn December, my sixth month living, working, and cycling in Greensboro, a young man asked me and my friend, Dan Gavin, where we got our bikes. The idea for BikeLab suddenly hit me. Hale County – of which Greensboro is the county seat – is one of the poorest in the nation and many of its citizens lack access to transportation. Hale County also happens to have very little car traffic, is relatively flat, and spread out just enough to make walking impractical; basically, it is perfect for bicycling. With the advice of several other bicycle co-ops and Dan''s maintenance skills, we founded BikeLab as a non-profit under Hero Housing (a local housing resource center) to begin to address this issue. Within the next six months we had helped three local youths build their own bikes out of donated parts – admittedly a small impact, but a measurable one.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter M Lab, I re-enrolled at MICA to finish my senior year. REBU!LD, my thesis, began after a walk through West Baltimore. Surrounded on either side by abandoned rowhomes, I found myself on what seemed to be an entirely empty block. However, as I continued, I noticed a child on the opposite side of the street stop in front of one of the homes. I suddenly realized that he lived there, on a block that was otherwise completely vacant and crumbling. Soon after, I learned of "New East Baltimore," and came to find that the 88-acre redevelopment was not too different from the block I had visited in the west. However here, the causes for displacement were much more obvious. For four months, I documented the redevelopment, through audio interviews – with residents (current and former), development employees, and local activists – and photography.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNot that I thought it could directly help the boy or one in his position, REBU!LD took the form of a website and an installation. For the website, I compiled both my audio and photographs to create a narrative to tell the story of the redevelopment. For the installation, which took place within the development footprint, I wheatpasted large-format photographs onto the boarded façades of an entirely vacant block. The installation and subsequent opening was meant to celebrate the remaining community, invite people to see the footprint for themselves, and provide a poignant contrast to the crumbling buildings my photographs appeared on.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand it, any one of these projects could be considered "social design"; they typify criteria like working with ethical clientele and design entrepreneurship. However, I can''t help but wonder why such a distinction is necessary, why shouldn''t these criteria be implicit in every graphic designer''s practice? This is not to say that graphic design is devoid of such projects or that they are completely unique. I can happily say that work like this is becoming more and more common. The website I completed for the UBBT is an example of working with an ethical organization and was a chance to utilize my skill set to complement and augment their good work. Designers like Silas Munro, the design director at the non-profit Housing Works, exemplify this idea by working in a sector where graphic design can rarely be afforded. The founding of BikeLab and REBU!LD represent examples of design entrepreneurship; first-hand experience, research, and most importantly, multi-disciplinary collaboration made their success possible. BikeLab could easily have been a Brute Labs project, where ideas are founded on extensive research into social ills and then funded by generous donors (grants and awards). REBU!LD, though it may be harder to classify under this criterion, is not unlike the work of The Center for Urban Pedagogy where graphic design, utilizing research and collaboration, decodes our urban environment and solicits participation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBy labeling these kinds of efforts as part of an emerging field called "social design", one that increasingly requires a Master''s degree, do we risk deterring "non-social designers" from pursuing similar efforts? By lumping the diverse approaches by graphic designers, architects, artists, computer developers etc… towards social good into a single "job" are we fostering an oxymoronic profession; a specialized jack-of-all-trades? Furthermore, in a world where the "triple bottom line" is rightly gaining momentum and the "greater good" is recognized as the common good, could "social design" be an oversimplification for young creatives working towards a future that requires collaboration and optimism?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="Photo1" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bd5Nkd6WB2E/Tou_Kx6SOcI/AAAAAAAAAEo/G1206eoMcLI/s320/rlecluyse_ubbt.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="179" />\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="photo2" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rfFtVRsjan0/Tou_KmszGuI/AAAAAAAAAEg/xM0q1lqDgNM/s320/rlecluyse_rb.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="179" />\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="photo3" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dngY9suQrd8/Tou_KofjyLI/AAAAAAAAAEY/6_UdwZ5nbR8/s320/rlecluyse_in_2.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="212" />\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="photo5" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M74EcjcPONk/Tou_KUaAwcI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/sd8i_XcCesc/s1600/rlecluyse_in_1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="794" />', 'What is Social Design?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '196-revision-4', '', '', '2012-10-31 02:54:25', '2012-10-31 02:54:25', '', 196, 'http://localhost:8888/2012/10/196-revision-4/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

BRUTE LABS has partnered with these volunteers to raise $110,000 towards building a new school for an impoverished Haitian community.\r\nIn November of 2010, a <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/11/30/131705055/the-tuesday-podcast-what-your-3-000-bought-in-haiti">Planet Money podcast</a> from NPR was heard by thousands of people, but only a handful stepped forward to take action. The podcast was about a Haitian community in desperate need of a solid plan to build a school for its children. Last week, I spoke with Tim Myers and Fred Ireland about what happened then, what''s happening now, and what happens next.\r\nTim Myers was a Project Manager for a construction company in Aspen for 20 years, and has a BS in Agriculture and Soil Science from Ohio State University. He also has a long history of volunteerism and education in the Aspen area, which he''s called home for 30 years. "I believe in education, science and math," Tim says, and he backs it up with his record of teaching the Math Counts and Destination Imagination programs in local schools for ten years.\r\nEven with his education volunteerism, after retiring from construction 6 years ago, Tim quickly realized he needed something else. After hearing the Planet Money podcast, he thought to himself, "this can''t be too difficult" and sent an email the following evening. Adam Davidson from NPR called Tim back the next day, and pretty soon Tim was on a plane to Haiti, set to volunteer with All Hands.\r\nHe arrived in late January, and spent his first week removing rubble from collapsed homes. His second week was spent at the site of the school in l''Artibonite, meeting with the principal and measuring the foundation. During week three, Tim volunteered at an orphanage in Port au Prince. The experiences during these three weeks were eye-opening for Tim in many ways, especially regarding what to avoid while constructing the new school.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1600"]<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A2zYCvKTqNA/ThvM_g0OGlI/AAAAAAAAADI/NTz-qX2OHio/s1600/Teachers%252C%2BPrincipal%2B%2526%2BTim.JPG"><img title="Tim Myers with the Haiti School''s Principal and teachers." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A2zYCvKTqNA/ThvM_g0OGlI/AAAAAAAAADI/NTz-qX2OHio/s1600/Teachers%252C%2BPrincipal%2B%2526%2BTim.JPG" alt="" width="1600" height="1064" /></a> Tim Myers with the Haiti School''s Principal and teachers.[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMany buildings in Haiti are constructed in a way that saves money, and skimps on cement while mixing the concrete. Dirty sand and water are also frequently used, and all of these things greatly compromise the structural integrity of buildings throughout the country. Tim noted that "this is is one of the single most detrimental factors in why a lot of the buildings in Haiti went down." A strong, secure foundation will be a top priority for the new school so it can withstand future disasters.\r\nTim wasn''t the only motivated good Samaritan who heard that podcast in November; Frederick Ireland was listening, too. Fred, who has his own Physical Therapy practice in North Carolina, says "it made me sad to think about these kids getting all pumped up about having a school, then having the rug pulled out from under them." He wasn''t quite sure how he could be of use, but he knew he wanted to help and eventually synced up with Tim. So far, Fred has been spending a lot of time working on the non-construction side of things; everything from creating proposals, drawing up plans, doing research on the work that''s already been done in Haiti, and digging up information on accepting donations.\r\nEach week, Fred and Tim have a conversation about the project status and divide tasks depending on areas of expertise and scheduling. Both men are heading to Haiti to visit the site in just a couple weeks. They agree that one of the biggest challenges the Haiti School Project faces is the logistics surrounding supplies. Things move much more slowly in Haiti, and often the hardware stores don''t stock basic bulk items. It can take 2-3 days to get a small truckload of building materials from Port au Prince. Materials also need to be guarded from theft on a 24/7 basis. And because the team will be trying to staff the building crew one hundred percent locally, another hurdle will be language. Translators are available, but sometimes the technical language of a building site doesn''t get conveyed perfectly.\r\nRight now of course, the biggest roadblock to breaking ground is reaching the $110,000 fundraising goal.

In his second update, we hear about the progress being made with the school’s principal and staff.\r\n"On Thursday, the gang piled into the truck about 9:00am so as to arrive at Villard (L''Artibonite region) about 10:00. After we arrived, Sabastien [driver and interpreter] made introductions all around. The principle, 5 of the school''s 7 teachers, the contractor who did the foundation and a parent of one of the students were present. We headed into the church for our first sitdown, Jack recording the event after asking permission. The usual pleasantries were exchanged as were some heartfelt thoughts about the project from both sides. We asked a lot of questions about how the school was currently run, the town, all the things our group had discussed the night before. Tim and I took turns asking and replying as the interaction moved forward. After a while we brought out the school renderings and Tim explained the plans through Sabastien''s interpretation. The school representatives were obviously impressed with the plans and the effort that had gone into them and they said so.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="320"]<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nNhsSE5oYpQ/TkrEwcFFERI/AAAAAAAAADQ/w2s5olNwHwE/s1600/Haiti%2BTrip%2B1.jpg"><img title="A snapshot taken during the drive to Villard" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nNhsSE5oYpQ/TkrEwcFFERI/AAAAAAAAADQ/w2s5olNwHwE/s320/Haiti%2BTrip%2B1.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" /></a> A snapshot taken during the drive to Villard[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTim, Jack and I were starting to overheat in the church, remember no electricity so no A/C, and asked to be shown around the church and school site. Behind the church are the outside classrooms. One was partially enclosed with tin the other covered by a tarp. Also behind the church was the pit toilet that served the church and school. We walked the school site with the partially completed foundation, made measurements and then took a walking tour of the village area immediately surrounding the church and school. We saw folks going about their business. There were women cooking in single pots out by the road, kids playing, a man carrying sticks in one hand and a machete in the other and  on and on.\r\nWe all returned to the school and talked more about the project. Tim and I wanted to make sure that our vision of the school was what the principle and teachers felt they needed. When we asked everyone present if they had any other questions one teacher simply asked "when", meaning when will the school be built. This was a really tough question for Tim and I. We knew how important the school was to the community. I tried to explain that we were not some big well funded NGO and that we could not start the building until we knew we had the funds to complete the school. I expressed that Tim, myself and our non-profit sponsors were working as hard as we could to get the word out and raise the needed funds but to put a specific time on completion would not be possible.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="320"]<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hfz2K7m7UXc/TkrFC14tRAI/AAAAAAAAADY/hGklFvQmRIY/s1600/Haiti%2BTrip%2B2.jpg"><img title="The team going over some plans" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hfz2K7m7UXc/TkrFC14tRAI/AAAAAAAAADY/hGklFvQmRIY/s320/Haiti%2BTrip%2B2.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" /></a> The team going over some plans[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe wrapped things up, said our goodbyes for the day and headed back to our hotel with the promise to meet again the next morning. We were all pretty spent from the experience. It was an emotional event for Tim and I, Sabastien was fatigued from trying to get our meaning across as accurately as possible and Jack was tired from taping and trying to get the sound right. As we headed off we all agreed that the day had been a success but that we now had our work cut out for us."\r\nIn our next post, we’ll get a glimpse into Tim’s thoughts upon leaving Haiti.

(230, 1, '2012-10-31 03:38:33', '2012-10-31 03:38:33', 'This week we have an update on two volunteers who are the the driving force behind the <a href="http://www.haitischoolproject.org">Haiti School Project</a>. BRUTE LABS has partnered with these volunteers to raise $110,000 towards building a new school for an impoverished Haitian community.\r\nIn November of 2010, a <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/11/30/131705055/the-tuesday-podcast-what-your-3-000-bought-in-haiti">Planet Money podcast</a> from NPR was heard by thousands of people, but only a handful stepped forward to take action. The podcast was about a Haitian community in desperate need of a solid plan to build a school for its children. Last week, I spoke with Tim Myers and Fred Ireland about what happened then, what''s happening now, and what happens next.\r\nTim Myers was a Project Manager for a construction company in Aspen for 20 years, and has a BS in Agriculture and Soil Science from Ohio State University. He also has a long history of volunteerism and education in the Aspen area, which he''s called home for 30 years. "I believe in education, science and math," Tim says, and he backs it up with his record of teaching the Math Counts and Destination Imagination programs in local schools for ten years.\r\nEven with his education volunteerism, after retiring from construction 6 years ago, Tim quickly realized he needed something else. After hearing the Planet Money podcast, he thought to himself, "this can''t be too difficult" and sent an email the following evening. Adam Davidson from NPR called Tim back the next day, and pretty soon Tim was on a plane to Haiti, set to volunteer with All Hands.\r\nHe arrived in late January, and spent his first week removing rubble from collapsed homes. His second week was spent at the site of the school in l''Artibonite, meeting with the principal and measuring the foundation. During week three, Tim volunteered at an orphanage in Port au Prince. The experiences during these three weeks were eye-opening for Tim in many ways, especially regarding what to avoid while constructing the new school.\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1600"]<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A2zYCvKTqNA/ThvM_g0OGlI/AAAAAAAAADI/NTz-qX2OHio/s1600/Teachers%252C%2BPrincipal%2B%2526%2BTim.JPG"><img title="Tim Myers with the Haiti School''s Principal and teachers." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A2zYCvKTqNA/ThvM_g0OGlI/AAAAAAAAADI/NTz-qX2OHio/s1600/Teachers%252C%2BPrincipal%2B%2526%2BTim.JPG" alt="" width="1600" height="1064" /></a> Tim Myers with the Haiti School''s Principal and teachers.[/caption]\r\n\r\nMany buildings in Haiti are constructed in a way that saves money, and skimps on cement while mixing the concrete. Dirty sand and water are also frequently used, and all of these things greatly compromise the structural integrity of buildings throughout the country. Tim noted that "this is is one of the single most detrimental factors in why a lot of the buildings in Haiti went down." A strong, secure foundation will be a top priority for the new school so it can withstand future disasters.\r\nTim wasn''t the only motivated good Samaritan who heard that podcast in November; Frederick Ireland was listening, too. Fred, who has his own Physical Therapy practice in North Carolina, says "it made me sad to think about these kids getting all pumped up about having a school, then having the rug pulled out from under them." He wasn''t quite sure how he could be of use, but he knew he wanted to help and eventually synced up with Tim. So far, Fred has been spending a lot of time working on the non-construction side of things; everything from creating proposals, drawing up plans, doing research on the work that''s already been done in Haiti, and digging up information on accepting donations.\r\nEach week, Fred and Tim have a conversation about the project status and divide tasks depending on areas of expertise and scheduling.

The podcast was about a Haitian community in desperate need of a solid plan to build a school for its children. Last week, I spoke with Tim Myers and Fred Ireland about what happened then, what''s happening now, and what happens next.\r\nTim Myers was a Project Manager for a construction company in Aspen for 20 years, and has a BS in Agriculture and Soil Science from Ohio State University. He also has a long history of volunteerism and education in the Aspen area, which he''s called home for 30 years. "I believe in education, science and math," Tim says, and he backs it up with his record of teaching the Math Counts and Destination Imagination programs in local schools for ten years.\r\nEven with his education volunteerism, after retiring from construction 6 years ago, Tim quickly realized he needed something else. After hearing the Planet Money podcast, he thought to himself, "this can''t be too difficult" and sent an email the following evening. Adam Davidson from NPR called Tim back the next day, and pretty soon Tim was on a plane to Haiti, set to volunteer with All Hands.\r\nHe arrived in late January, and spent his first week removing rubble from collapsed homes. His second week was spent at the site of the school in l''Artibonite, meeting with the principal and measuring the foundation. During week three, Tim volunteered at an orphanage in Port au Prince.

As one farmer and mother explained, "It''s really hard for the farmers here to compete with free rice, so they''re making a lot less money."\r\n\r\nThe families here have to choose between selling their rice to cover expenses, or eating it to quell their hunger. Lately, they''ve been choosing the former to cover their main expense: the children''s $45 annual school tuition. The parents here know that education is the key to their children escaping poverty and leading better lives. But with the economic state the rice farmers are caught in, many can''t afford to pay the tuition at all.\r\n\r\nThe school''s already in bad shape. In fact, it''s not even a school. It''s a one-room church with blackboards precariously leaning against the walls, where students sit in pews and take notes in their lap. More children are taught outside under a tarp, where the heat is so stifling it''s hard to breathe. Because the conditions here can''t be sustained with the lack of tuition payments, things will only get worse.

As one farmer and mother explained, "It''s really hard for the farmers here to compete with free rice, so they''re making a lot less money."\r\n\r\nThe families here have to choose between selling their rice to cover expenses, or eating it to quell their hunger. Lately, they''ve been choosing the former to cover their main expense: the children''s $45 annual school tuition. The parents here know that education is the key to their children escaping poverty and leading better lives. But with the economic state the rice farmers are caught in, many can''t afford to pay the tuition at all.\r\n\r\nThe school''s already in bad shape. In fact, it''s not even a school. It''s a one-room church with blackboards precariously leaning against the walls, where students sit in pews and take notes in their lap. More children are taught outside under a tarp, where the heat is so stifling it''s hard to breathe. Because the conditions here can''t be sustained with the lack of tuition payments, things will only get worse. Something needs to be done.\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="375"]<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ahK6rkIT5ns/TgpelmY2cZI/AAAAAAAAAC4/X1tj0Fo0tb0/s1600/Haitian%2BChildren%2B3.jpg"><img title="Children in the temporary outdoor classroom with tin siding and covered by a tarp" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ahK6rkIT5ns/TgpelmY2cZI/AAAAAAAAAC4/X1tj0Fo0tb0/s400/Haitian%2BChildren%2B3.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="249" /></a> Children in the temporary outdoor classroom with tin siding and covered by a tarp[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter hearing about the urgent need for help in l''Artibonite, a retired builder from Colorado named Tim Myers volunteered to spearhead the construction of a new school for this community. Joining him is Fred Ireland, a doctorate in Exercise Physiology from Philadelphia. These two men have partnered with <a href="http://www.brutelabs.org/">BRUTE LABS</a>, a nonprofit based out of California committed to tackling global challenged using design and technology. The goal is to raise $110,000 to build a new school for these families being forced to choose between education and eating.\r\nYou can help too, by donating to the cause and spreading the word. <a href="http://www.brutelabs.org/Haiti/">Visit our site</a> to make a donation.

(251, 1, '2011-05-08 19:01:36', '2011-05-08 19:01:36', 'I met Josh To in southern Haiti last year through a mutual friend. He was there with BRUTE LABS doing a needs assessment, I was working for an American NGO and we’ve kept in touch since then. I found aid work to be a wonderful way to visit exciting places, and after briefly seeing Cairo during the Egyptian Revolution I was eager to get back to the Middle East. With the prospect of starting a master’s degree only a few months away, I decided to travel to Libya to try to find a relief worker job as I had done with relative ease in Haiti a year ago. The few aid organizations that had arrived in Libya, however, were still weeks away from hiring staff and thus I was relegated to the role of freelance photographer and spent most of my time traveling with a journalist I’d also met in Haiti. Josh asked me to share my experiences and feelings from the trip. There is so much to say, but I’ll keep it to the feelings I remember most vividly, along with a few observations about the developing situation in Libya. I should mention that after a month there, I still have no idea how to spell Qaddafi but I’m going with the New York Times’ version.\r\n\r\nWitnessing the Libyan Civil War provided a surreal contrast of the finest qualities of human beings, and the absolute worst. Warmth, hospitality, and the eternal struggle of man to be free, seen alongside the atrocities committed by Qaddafi forces, many of whom were fighting for money rather than a cause. I saw the horrible, heartbreaking realities of war but I think I’ll remember the time I spent with the rebels more, for their courage, kindness and grace in their country’s darkest hour. Almost immediately after setting foot in Benghazi I was charmed by the generosity of the Libyan people. Many had never seen a Westerner before, and yet treated each of us as a long-lost brother. When our bus into town arrived around 3 AM, a Libyan man we had only just met offered us a place to stay the night. When we awoke the next morning, we found that he had offered us his bedroom while he slept on the couch. After only the briefest of introductions, I was routinely invited to sit in family homes for lunch, coffee, and conversations in the universal language of smiles.\r\nRegarding my thoughts on the war itself, I can only say that I hope it ends quickly, although that does not seem likely at this point. Without a doubt, there is plenty of blame to share for the current stalemate. The rebels thought that after they expelled government troops from Benghazi that Qaddafi would bow to popular and Western pressure like Ali and Mubarak before him. They never considered the possibility that they would have to fight his armored divisions and foreign mercenaries for every inch from Benghazi to Tripoli. For its part, NATO has already implemented the Council’s first and most important request, of setting up a no-fly zone over Libya that has so far prevented any airborne assaults from Qaddafi loyalists. But you give a mouse a cookie and he’s gonna want some air strikes, specifically on Qaddafi’s missile batteries and other heavy artillery. Many Libyans cannot fathom why NATO would sit idly by with its vastly superior weaponry while rebels soldiers fall to Qaddafi’s mortars, missiles, and tanks. The most alarming aspect of the stalemate is that between Qaddafi’s mountain of cash and the rebel-controlled eastern oil fields, both sides have the money to keep the conflict going indefinitely.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIn the media, the Transitional Council found its greatest advantage over the Qaddafi regime. At the onset of the fighting, Western journalists were offered free 5 night stays at the Hotel Ouzu, Benghazi’s grand hotel, subsidized by the Transitional Council’s petrodollars. Press conferences with Transitional Council spokesmen, military leaders and even the Libyan Boy Scouts are advertised in the Ouzu lobby each day, and the Council’s Media Center is a phone call away for any journalist needing a translator or ride to the front lines. Meanwhile, journalists in Tripoli are herded around the city to staged pro-government events that often include schoolchildren acting like overjoyed Epcot center robots or Qaddafi spasmodically shaking his fists from the sunroof of a limousine, looking more like the corpse-puppet of “Weekend at Bernie’s” than a head of state.\r\nIf you had asked me at the beginning of 2011 whether I would approve of U.S. involvement in a third conflict in the Middle East, I would have said no regardless of the circumstances. After seeing Benghazi, I firmly believe that the U.S. made the right choice. To anyone upset with President Obama for “dragging the country into a war without consulting the American people” please understand this: Qaddafi’s tanks were about 5 miles from the Benghazi city limits when the international coalition destroyed them. The Qaddafi loyalists’ clearly stated goal was the annihilation of the uprising in the de facto rebel capital, a city of over 700,000. There was no time for congressional hearings and I, for one, am glad that there wasn’t a massacre in Benghazi. Nicolas Sarkozy’s comically early recognition of the Transitional Council and commitment of military support that he must have known only the U.S. or NATO could provide smacked of a lonely teenager: in seeking acceptance, offering to drive his friends to the movies before asking his father if he could borrow the car. As much as Sarko’s godlike status in Libya made my American blood boil, even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while and he is to be commended for issuing the initial rallying cry. It remains to be seen how long the honeymoon between Libya and the West will last, but at the very least I believe that Libyans will remember that NATO averted a bloodbath in Benghazi.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe Libyan citizenry has heard all the negative things about America--our lust for oil, our history of meddling in other countries’ affairs—and for the most part they genuinely believe the U.S. and NATO are here to help. One Libyan man said to me “Look, we know America is not a charity, but we think they come to help now. If they want to buy our oil afterwards, so what? What are we going to do with it, drink it?” I sincerely hope NATO continues to take care to handle the situation here thoughtfully. Much has been said about the “rag-tag” rebel army, with Robert Gates referring to the rebellion as not much more than a “pick-up game.” That’s an accurate assessment, but the rebel army is not without its merits. I was awed by the bravery I saw in Libya, and inspired by the unwavering commitment to secular democracy and freedom from tyranny (see: American Revolution). It takes an intense desire for freedom and democracy (not to mention balls of solid brass) to hop into a ’85 Toyota with a Soviet-era machine gun and engage a tank division. The rebels want to liberate Tripoli themselves, without foreign ground troops, and want Qaddafi alive for a trial, not executed. They understand the difficulties inherent in asking for airstrikes from countries who are already weary of Middle Eastern conflicts, and vaguely suspicious of the Middle East in general, but the fact that they’re asking shows they want a positive relationship with the West\r\n\r\nThe rebel cause is unmistakably the right “side of history” to which President Obama refers. The potential gains from being on the right side of Libyan history are enormous; a democratic, capitalistic and wealthy pro-Western Islamic society. The alternative is frightening; another strategically located, oil-rich Middle Eastern country with a heart broken by the West and an open ear to fundamentalist rhetoric. Like I said before, I hope that NATO and the rebels begin to communicate more effectively and bring a swift end to this war, but both parties have their work cut out for them.\r\n\r\nIt’s a difficult choice in a town of such overwhelming hospitality, but my favorite place to be in Benghazi was Karaman, a quaint, smoky Turkish restaurant run by the jolly Artur. Artur speaks Turkish, Arabic and even German from a 15-year stay in Bonn. I can butcher enough German words that we could communicate and since most of my German vocabulary relates to drinking anyways--and Artur pours his 180 proof moonshine liberally for his friends--we quickly developed a glorious, if hazy, friendship. After founding successful restaurants in Turkey, Germany and Holland, he chose to open one in Benghazi because of the massive influx of workers from Turkish companies. On my last night in town I asked him if he intended to stay in Benghazi for long. “No!” he replied emphatically. “The people don’t drink, they cover up their women.

(252, 1, '2012-10-31 18:57:48', '2012-10-31 18:57:48', 'I met Josh To in southern Haiti last year through a mutual friend. He was there with BRUTE LABS doing a needs assessment, I was working for an American NGO and we’ve kept in touch since then. I found aid work to be a wonderful way to visit exciting places, and after briefly seeing Cairo during the Egyptian Revolution I was eager to get back to the Middle East. With the prospect of starting a master’s degree only a few months away, I decided to travel to Libya to try to find a relief worker job as I had done with relative ease in Haiti a year ago. The few aid organizations that had arrived in Libya, however, were still weeks away from hiring staff and thus I was relegated to the role of freelance photographer and spent most of my time traveling with a journalist I’d also met in Haiti. Josh asked me to share my experiences and feelings from the trip. There is so much to say, but I’ll keep it to the feelings I remember most vividly, along with a few observations about the developing situation in Libya. I should mention that after a month there, I still have no idea how to spell Qaddafi but I’m going with the New York Times’ version.\n\nWitnessing the Libyan Civil War provided a surreal contrast of the finest qualities of human beings, and the absolute worst. Warmth, hospitality, and the eternal struggle of man to be free, seen alongside the atrocities committed by Qaddafi forces, many of whom were fighting for money rather than a cause. I saw the horrible, heartbreaking realities of war but I think I’ll remember the time I spent with the rebels more, for their courage, kindness and grace in their country’s darkest hour. Almost immediately after setting foot in Benghazi I was charmed by the generosity of the Libyan people. Many had never seen a Westerner before, and yet treated each of us as a long-lost brother. When our bus into town arrived around 3 AM, a Libyan man we had only just met offered us a place to stay the night. When we awoke the next morning, we found that he had offered us his bedroom while he slept on the couch. After only the briefest of introductions, I was routinely invited to sit in family homes for lunch, coffee, and conversations in the universal language of smiles.\nRegarding my thoughts on the war itself, I can only say that I hope it ends quickly, although that does not seem likely at this point. Without a doubt, there is plenty of blame to share for the current stalemate. The rebels thought that after they expelled government troops from Benghazi that Qaddafi would bow to popular and Western pressure like Ali and Mubarak before him. They never considered the possibility that they would have to fight his armored divisions and foreign mercenaries for every inch from Benghazi to Tripoli. For its part, NATO has already implemented the Council’s first and most important request, of setting up a no-fly zone over Libya that has so far prevented any airborne assaults from Qaddafi loyalists. But you give a mouse a cookie and he’s gonna want some air strikes, specifically on Qaddafi’s missile batteries and other heavy artillery. Many Libyans cannot fathom why NATO would sit idly by with its vastly superior weaponry while rebels soldiers fall to Qaddafi’s mortars, missiles, and tanks. The most alarming aspect of the stalemate is that between Qaddafi’s mountain of cash and the rebel-controlled eastern oil fields, both sides have the money to keep the conflict going indefinitely.\n\n&nbsp;\nIn the media, the Transitional Council found its greatest advantage over the Qaddafi regime. At the onset of the fighting, Western journalists were offered free 5 night stays at the Hotel Ouzu, Benghazi’s grand hotel, subsidized by the Transitional Council’s petrodollars. Press conferences with Transitional Council spokesmen, military leaders and even the Libyan Boy Scouts are advertised in the Ouzu lobby each day, and the Council’s Media Center is a phone call away for any journalist needing a translator or ride to the front lines. Meanwhile, journalists in Tripoli are herded around the city to staged pro-government events that often include schoolchildren acting like overjoyed Epcot center robots or Qaddafi spasmodically shaking his fists from the sunroof of a limousine, looking more like the corpse-puppet of “Weekend at Bernie’s” than a head of state.\nIf you had asked me at the beginning of 2011 whether I would approve of U.S. involvement in a third conflict in the Middle East, I would have said no regardless of the circumstances. After seeing Benghazi, I firmly believe that the U.S. made the right choice. To anyone upset with President Obama for “dragging the country into a war without consulting the American people” please understand this: Qaddafi’s tanks were about 5 miles from the Benghazi city limits when the international coalition destroyed them. The Qaddafi loyalists’ clearly stated goal was the annihilation of the uprising in the de facto rebel capital, a city of over 700,000. There was no time for congressional hearings and I, for one, am glad that there wasn’t a massacre in Benghazi. Nicolas Sarkozy’s comically early recognition of the Transitional Council and commitment of military support that he must have known only the U.S. or NATO could provide smacked of a lonely teenager: in seeking acceptance, offering to drive his friends to the movies before asking his father if he could borrow the car. As much as Sarko’s godlike status in Libya made my American blood boil, even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while and he is to be commended for issuing the initial rallying cry. It remains to be seen how long the honeymoon between Libya and the West will last, but at the very least I believe that Libyans will remember that NATO averted a bloodbath in Benghazi.\n\n&nbsp;\nThe Libyan citizenry has heard all the negative things about America--our lust for oil, our history of meddling in other countries’ affairs—and for the most part they genuinely believe the U.S. and NATO are here to help. One Libyan man said to me “Look, we know America is not a charity, but we think they come to help now. If they want to buy our oil afterwards, so what? What are we going to do with it, drink it?” I sincerely hope NATO continues to take care to handle the situation here thoughtfully. Much has been said about the “rag-tag” rebel army, with Robert Gates referring to the rebellion as not much more than a “pick-up game.” That’s an accurate assessment, but the rebel army is not without its merits. I was awed by the bravery I saw in Libya, and inspired by the unwavering commitment to secular democracy and freedom from tyranny (see: American Revolution). It takes an intense desire for freedom and democracy (not to mention balls of solid brass) to hop into a ’85 Toyota with a Soviet-era machine gun and engage a tank division. The rebels want to liberate Tripoli themselves, without foreign ground troops, and want Qaddafi alive for a trial, not executed. They understand the difficulties inherent in asking for airstrikes from countries who are already weary of Middle Eastern conflicts, and vaguely suspicious of the Middle East in general, but the fact that they’re asking shows they want a positive relationship with the West\n\nThe rebel cause is unmistakably the right “side of history” to which President Obama refers. The potential gains from being on the right side of Libyan history are enormous; a democratic, capitalistic and wealthy pro-Western Islamic society. The alternative is frightening; another strategically located, oil-rich Middle Eastern country with a heart broken by the West and an open ear to fundamentalist rhetoric. Like I said before, I hope that NATO and the rebels begin to communicate more effectively and bring a swift end to this war, but both parties have their work cut out for them.\n\nIt’s a difficult choice in a town of such overwhelming hospitality, but my favorite place to be in Benghazi was Karaman, a quaint, smoky Turkish restaurant run by the jolly Artur. Artur speaks Turkish, Arabic and even German from a 15-year stay in Bonn. I can butcher enough German words that we could communicate and since most of my German vocabulary relates to drinking anyways--and Artur pours his 180 proof moonshine liberally for his friends--we quickly developed a glorious, if hazy, friendship. After founding successful restaurants in Turkey, Germany and Holland, he chose to open one in Benghazi because of the massive influx of workers from Turkish companies. On my last night in town I asked him if he intended to stay in Benghazi for long. “No!” he replied emphatically. “The people don’t drink, they cover up their women. They are not right in the head and they won’t change when Qaddafi is gone.” I clinked glasses with Artur based on our mutual appreciation of a stiff drink and an emancipated woman, but I disagree with my friend on his last point. I believe Libyans are just fine in the head and clearly committed to change. They’ve demonstrated as much by sacrificing their very lives for it, and need only to be rid of their ruthless dictator and to find a market for their vast oil reserves (I’m pretty sure someone will be interested) to begin building a progressive, democratic society.\n\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1280"]<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Rx0QN4GxkIE/Tccl8oLzTrI/AAAAAAAAAB8/PyGW-NIO8ow/s1600/IMG_6543.jpg"><img title="A man jumps over the wall of a shelled building in Ajdabiya" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Rx0QN4GxkIE/Tccl8oLzTrI/AAAAAAAAAB8/PyGW-NIO8ow/s1600/IMG_6543.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" /></a> A man jumps over the wall of a shelled building in Ajdabiya[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;', '', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '251-revision', '', '', '2012-10-31 18:57:48', '2012-10-31 18:57:48', '', 251, 'http://localhost:8888/2012/10/251-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

They’ve demonstrated as much by sacrificing their very lives for it, and need only to be rid of their ruthless dictator and to find a market for their vast oil reserves (I’m pretty sure someone will be interested) to begin building a progressive, democratic society.\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1280"]<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Rx0QN4GxkIE/Tccl8oLzTrI/AAAAAAAAAB8/PyGW-NIO8ow/s1600/IMG_6543.jpg"><img title="A man jumps over the wall of a shelled building in Ajdabiya" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Rx0QN4GxkIE/Tccl8oLzTrI/AAAAAAAAAB8/PyGW-NIO8ow/s1600/IMG_6543.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" /></a> A man jumps over the wall of a shelled building in Ajdabiya[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1280"]<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RpPATVbAIA0/Tccl8rNklFI/AAAAAAAAAB0/J8Vfe3CaXYA/s1600/IMG_6515.jpg"><img title="An unexploded shell wedged next to an herb garden in the courtyard of an Ajdabiya home" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RpPATVbAIA0/Tccl8rNklFI/AAAAAAAAAB0/J8Vfe3CaXYA/s1600/IMG_6515.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" /></a> An unexploded shell wedged next to an herb garden in the courtyard of an Ajdabiya home[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WQgCdMxHvbo/Tccl8SUJXMI/AAAAAAAAABs/Ka2Vv9f5oSw/s400/IMG_6375.jpg"><img class="alignnone" title="Friday prayers in Benghazi, Qaddafi banned public gatherings so this is the first time in four decades Libyans have been able to freely express themselves" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WQgCdMxHvbo/Tccl8SUJXMI/AAAAAAAAABs/Ka2Vv9f5oSw/s400/IMG_6375.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="400" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="400"]<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k-Jsf96dUU8/Tccl8LWNCsI/AAAAAAAAABk/s35glDntF4M/s400/IMG_6359.jpg"><img title="“No Al Qaeda, No Hezbollah” sign at Friday prayers in Benghazi" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k-Jsf96dUU8/Tccl8LWNCsI/AAAAAAAAABk/s35glDntF4M/s400/IMG_6359.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" /></a> “No Al Qaeda, No Hezbollah” sign at Friday prayers in Benghazi[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="400"]<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fR_qOMXidSg/Tccl72VgWLI/AAAAAAAAABc/zyoYisI9UE8/s400/IMG_6358.jpg"><img title="A Libyan man waves an American flag at Friday prayers in Benghazi" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fR_qOMXidSg/Tccl72VgWLI/AAAAAAAAABc/zyoYisI9UE8/s400/IMG_6358.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" /></a> A Libyan man waves an American flag at Friday prayers in Benghazi[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="400"]<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7by4CbW1q8g/TccloApKXjI/AAAAAAAAABM/MF2YLRflzo8/s400/IMG_6223.jpg"><img title="A pickup truck fashioned into a convertible to accommodate a rocket battery" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7by4CbW1q8g/TccloApKXjI/AAAAAAAAABM/MF2YLRflzo8/s400/IMG_6223.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" /></a> A pickup truck fashioned into a convertible to accommodate a rocket battery[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1280"]<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Pm6zxMRM3JQ/TcclnyM7ffI/AAAAAAAAABE/MPCbmiPctYs/s1600/IMG_6150.jpg"><img class=" " title="A rebel soldier throws up a peace sign while manning an anti-aircraft gun near the front lines" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Pm6zxMRM3JQ/TcclnyM7ffI/AAAAAAAAABE/MPCbmiPctYs/s1600/IMG_6150.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" /></a> A rebel soldier throws up a peace sign while manning an anti-aircraft gun near the front lines[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="400"]<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O7DpUjBGrWY/TcclnZELCFI/AAAAAAAAAA8/9awtLPpoPrU/s1600/IMG_6125.jpg"><img title="Remnants of a tank destroyed by NATO on the outskirts of Benghazi" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O7DpUjBGrWY/TcclnZELCFI/AAAAAAAAAA8/9awtLPpoPrU/s400/IMG_6125.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" /></a> Remnants of a tank destroyed by NATO on the outskirts of Benghazi[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="400"]<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pRya8vAjh28/TcclnKSKtsI/AAAAAAAAAA0/NdEEkrqEdCk/s400/IMG_6088.jpg"><img title="A 15 year old rebel, injured in the initial uprising in Benghazi, waits for his leg to heal." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pRya8vAjh28/TcclnKSKtsI/AAAAAAAAAA0/NdEEkrqEdCk/s400/IMG_6088.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" /></a> A 15 year old rebel, injured in the initial uprising in Benghazi, waits for his leg to heal.[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'A BRUTE friend in Lybia', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '251-revision-2', '', '', '2012-10-31 19:01:36', '2012-10-31 19:01:36', '', 251, 'http://localhost:8888/2012/10/251-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It''s also engaging in that it captures an extremely visceral moment -- a snapshot at or right before a moment of impact--the loud THWAPP! of a ball slapping leather.

But, after flipping the image right side up and catching sight of that glorious "M" and "b” for the first time, my transformation was complete.

Shuttered windows tug at you and force you to try reconciling where the city is now with the glory days of the past. You can’t help but to think to yourself: How could this happen? This was the Paris of the West, after all.\r\nThese realities scream at you from nearly all directions. Despite these truths, the most lasting impressions from our Midwestern expedition aren’t centered around disrepair and disbelief. Instead, we left feeling inspired and with a richer understanding of the city. We couldn’t help but to take account of how the most lasting memories from the trip focus on the amazing people that we met. In many respects, the adversity that the city has faced has afforded a unique amount of opportunity to the people of Detroit to be entrepreneurial or innovative in their approach to solving problems. The folks that we met are truly and fully committed to the rebuilding of a better cultural, political and economic future for Detroiters.\r\nOne-sided media reports and irregularly attended sociology classes colored some of the ignorance apparent in my previous <a href="http://blog.brutelabs.org/2010/12/has-america-forgotten-about-detroit.html">post</a>. But our experience in Detroit enlightened us and positioned us to speak more responsibly about the collapse and rebirth of Detroit. From a city that we knew nothing of, to a city that we love.

So Danny Bowman, Joshua Knox and I packed up our winter gear and headed off to Motor City, USA. The intent was to network with folks on the forefront of the revitalization efforts, drop by a museum or two, take in some of the local eateries and attend the <a href="http://www.naias.com/">North American International Auto Show</a>!\r\n“What brought you to Detroit in January?” each person we visited with asked after learning that we hailed from the sunny skies of California.\r\nAdmittedly, we didn’t have a good answer. I guess January seemed as ripe a time to us as any to learn something new. And learn something new, we did.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the trip was broad. In the span of about 4 days, we wanted to learn about the past, present and future of our destination. The landmarks, the museums and the neighborhoods yelled out their stories to us. Yet, these stories wouldn’t have crystallized without the input from some of the amazing leaders that we had a chance to sit down with and learn from.\r\nWe got a glimpse into Veronika’s efforts to combat the difficulties faced by the 32k homeless living on the streets of Detroit during the Winter season. While taking a walk down memory lane, Tom and Peggy Brennan showed us how an old Model T showroom is playing host to the builders of a more sustainable and entrepreneurial future for the city. Two seasoned business leaders, Brian Balasia and Ken Agacinski, shared with us their journey towards economic revitalization, and Karla Henderson at City Hall explained how demolition and community engagement marks the beginning of the rebuilding process. Lisa Richter even gave us a chance to taste delicious lettuce defiantly growing in the harsh winter weather.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="500"]<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eKX1hEEC60E/TWMKhTbcpPI/AAAAAAAAAEI/hAXKhOFlesw/s1600/DetroitPost1.jpg"><img title="Hanging with Lisa Richter from Earthworks Urban Farm" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eKX1hEEC60E/TWMKhTbcpPI/AAAAAAAAAEI/hAXKhOFlesw/s1600/DetroitPost1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a> Hanging with Lisa Richter from Earthworks Urban Farm[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNo one person was more influential to the orchestration of our trip than Phillip Cooley, a local developer and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/17/huffposts-greatest-person_4_n_784906.html">nationally-recognized</a> leader in Detroit’s urban revitalization movement.

Lisa Richter even gave us a chance to taste delicious lettuce defiantly growing in the harsh winter weather.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="500"]<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eKX1hEEC60E/TWMKhTbcpPI/AAAAAAAAAEI/hAXKhOFlesw/s1600/DetroitPost1.jpg"><img title="Hanging with Lisa Richter from Earthworks Urban Farm" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eKX1hEEC60E/TWMKhTbcpPI/AAAAAAAAAEI/hAXKhOFlesw/s1600/DetroitPost1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a> Hanging with Lisa Richter from Earthworks Urban Farm[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNo one person was more influential to the orchestration of our trip than Phillip Cooley, a local developer and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/17/huffposts-greatest-person_4_n_784906.html">nationally-recognized</a> leader in Detroit’s urban revitalization movement. Phillip is in every sense of the word a true community organizer that extended his hand to a group of strangers and served as an ambassador for his hometown.

Shuttered windows tug at you and force you to try reconciling where the city is now with the glory days of the past. You can’t help but to think to yourself: How could this happen? This was the Paris of the West, after all.\r\nThese realities scream at you from nearly all directions. Despite these truths, the most lasting impressions from our Midwestern expedition aren’t centered around disrepair and disbelief. Instead, we left feeling inspired and with a richer understanding of the city. We couldn’t help but to take account of how the most lasting memories from the trip focus on the amazing people that we met. In many respects, the adversity that the city has faced has afforded a unique amount of opportunity to the people of Detroit to be entrepreneurial or innovative in their approach to solving problems. The folks that we met are truly and fully committed to the rebuilding of a better cultural, political and economic future for Detroiters.\r\nOne-sided media reports and irregularly attended sociology classes colored some of the ignorance apparent in my previous <a href="http://blog.brutelabs.org/2010/12/has-america-forgotten-about-detroit.html">post</a>. But our experience in Detroit enlightened us and positioned us to speak more responsibly about the collapse and rebirth of Detroit. From a city that we knew nothing of, to a city that we love.

(280, 1, '2010-12-13 20:01:56', '2010-12-13 20:01:56', 'In October, alongside a group of eager volunteers, I journeyed to New Orleans. Our team visited all of the local hot spots. Partying on Bourbon Street. Scarfing down some of the best seafood you’ll ever eat in your life. Marveling at the fact that the city is below sea level and gawking at what still appears to be an inadequate levee system.\r\nOne emotional discussion with locals after another unveiled terrifying tales of torment and unbelievable acts of courage. Many of those affected by Katrina have been to hell and back, and stuck around to tell the story. Their land and their bodies physically carry the scars acquired during the immeasurable devastation produced on those dark days in 2005.\r\n\r\nMost visible to the untrained eye, was the trail of torn and tattered homes left behind by the temperamental storm. While most storms are ephemeral in nature, for many, the rains from Katrina have yet to stop falling; the violent winds have not yet ceased. Block after block. Story after story. It became clear to me what it meant to make it through a natural disaster. I grew certain that only a special kind of person could be strong enough to come back to the scene of the incident and work relentlessly to piece their own, and the lives of others, back together.\r\nThe experience was an eye-opening one and gave me the chance to fall in love with the city. Yet, oddly enough, throughout the duration of my trip I couldn’t help but to think of other American cities that have coped with devastation. Hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters quickly grab attention the world over. But other, more systematic, forms of social shock/collapse fail to grab headlines in the same way.\r\n<strong>Case in point: Detroit, Michigan</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.utne.com/uploadedImages/utne/blogs/Arts/Detroit-blight.jpg?n=4331"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.utne.com/uploadedImages/utne/blogs/Arts/Detroit-blight.jpg?n=4331" alt="" width="510" height="340" /></a>\r\n\r\nToday, the city copes with all of the same issues one can expect a major American city to cope with. However, it has yet to recreate the necessary conditions for attracting and retaining the key inputs required for making a city thrive financially, as well as culturally.\r\nThere was no storm to report on the evening news. There was no sudden rattling of a defenseless population. There is just the status quo. A series of decisions made in years past have produced outcomes in Detroit that are less than pleasant. Unfortunately, there is no united call to arms by everyday people across the country, or around the world, rallying to light a spark under Detroit.\r\nHowever, this doesn’t mean that work isn’t being done! It just means that we don’t know much about it. To help combat our ignorance, myself and a few good BRUTEs will be putting on our winter coats and traveling east. We’re looking for the movers and shakers in Detroit that can teach us a thing or two about the grassroots efforts aimed at rebuilding greatness.\r\nTraveling to New Orleans lit a fire under me. The Gulf Coast region is undoubtedly one that will need ongoing internal and external support. Yet, I feel it’s high time that we begin to jog the collective memory of a nation that has seemingly forgotten about a city that was once great, and can be great again.\r\n<em>If you’re in the Detroit area from January 13th through January 17th, 2011, please let me know.

(282, 1, '2012-10-31 20:01:56', '2012-10-31 20:01:56', 'In October, alongside a group of eager volunteers, I journeyed to New Orleans. Our team visited all of the local hot spots. Partying on Bourbon Street. Scarfing down some of the best seafood you’ll ever eat in your life. Marveling at the fact that the city is below sea level and gawking at what still appears to be an inadequate levee system.\r\nOne emotional discussion with locals after another unveiled terrifying tales of torment and unbelievable acts of courage. Many of those affected by Katrina have been to hell and back, and stuck around to tell the story. Their land and their bodies physically carry the scars acquired during the immeasurable devastation produced on those dark days in 2005.\r\n\r\nMost visible to the untrained eye, was the trail of torn and tattered homes left behind by the temperamental storm. While most storms are ephemeral in nature, for many, the rains from Katrina have yet to stop falling; the violent winds have not yet ceased. Block after block. Story after story. It became clear to me what it meant to make it through a natural disaster. I grew certain that only a special kind of person could be strong enough to come back to the scene of the incident and work relentlessly to piece their own, and the lives of others, back together.\r\nThe experience was an eye-opening one and gave me the chance to fall in love with the city. Yet, oddly enough, throughout the duration of my trip I couldn’t help but to think of other American cities that have coped with devastation. Hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters quickly grab attention the world over. But other, more systematic, forms of social shock/collapse fail to grab headlines in the same way.\r\n<strong>Case in point: Detroit, Michigan</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.utne.com/uploadedImages/utne/blogs/Arts/Detroit-blight.jpg?n=4331"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.utne.com/uploadedImages/utne/blogs/Arts/Detroit-blight.jpg?n=4331" alt="" width="510" height="340" /></a>\r\n\r\nToday, the city copes with all of the same issues one can expect a major American city to cope with. However, it has yet to recreate the necessary conditions for attracting and retaining the key inputs required for making a city thrive financially, as well as culturally.\r\nThere was no storm to report on the evening news. There was no sudden rattling of a defenseless population. There is just the status quo. A series of decisions made in years past have produced outcomes in Detroit that are less than pleasant. Unfortunately, there is no united call to arms by everyday people across the country, or around the world, rallying to light a spark under Detroit.\r\nHowever, this doesn’t mean that work isn’t being done! It just means that we don’t know much about it. To help combat our ignorance, myself and a few good BRUTEs will be putting on our winter coats and traveling east. We’re looking for the movers and shakers in Detroit that can teach us a thing or two about the grassroots efforts aimed at rebuilding greatness.\r\nTraveling to New Orleans lit a fire under me. The Gulf Coast region is undoubtedly one that will need ongoing internal and external support. Yet, I feel it’s high time that we begin to jog the collective memory of a nation that has seemingly forgotten about a city that was once great, and can be great again.\r\n<em>If you’re in the Detroit area from January 13th through January 17th, 2011, please let me know.

(288, 1, '2010-11-19 20:07:30', '2010-11-19 20:07:30', 'Gabe Francis, a friend of BRUTE LABS, was a guest blogger just before he embarked on his Kiva fellowship in Costa Rica. Below he shares his reflections of his work as he prepared to return to the concrete jungle in New York he calls home.\r\n-\r\nWhen asked what they think of Costa Rica most people usually refer to the poster in their local travel agency, white palm beaches, virgin cloud forests, and toucans. Yet, there is a side of Costa Rica that the tour packages pouring out of San Jose regrettably fail to recount. The truth is, while eco-tourism and liberal trade agreements have brought prosperity to some in Costa Rica, many Ticos still live below the poverty line. Is ignorance bliss? We Kiva Lenders know better.  My name is Gabriel Francis, and I am a Kiva Fellow working with FUDECOSUR, a Kiva field partner based in rural southern Costa Rica. With only two weeks left of my fellowship I can hardly believe I will soon be on a plane trading tropical rainforests for the concrete jungles of New York City.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://kivafellows.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img_1493-large.jpg?w=455&amp;h=302"><img class="alignnone" src="http://kivafellows.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img_1493-large.jpg?w=455&amp;h=302" alt="" width="455" height="302" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Kiva’s Field Partner FUDECOSUR</strong>\r\nAs a Kiva Fellow, I was placed with one of Kiva’s Field Partners to provide support and transparency into the money lending process. As you may know, all entrepreneurs on Kiva’s web site are supported by local Field Partners, or microfinance institutions (MFIs) like FUDECOSUR, who are Kiva’s liaison between Kiva lenders and Kiva borrowers. They choose which of their clients are eligible to receive Kiva support, write and upload business profiles, disburse loans, collect payments, write journal updates, and respond to lender comments. Currently, FUDECOSUR is one of three MFIs in Costa Rica and the only to focus exclusively on Costa Rica’s impoverished agricultural region.\r\nSouthern Costa Rica is ripe for Micro-Finance innovation. For a majority of FUDECOSUR’s clients their Kiva loan is the first loan they have ever received, and in some cases ever qualified for. Despite an abundance of national banking options and agricultural credit unions in the area most loan terms are too steep to afford and bank branches too difficult to reach over the muddy unpaved roads. FUDECOSUR specifically tailors its loans to serve this marginalized client base. By operating on a village banking model FUDECOSUR empowers local communities to manage their own credit resources. With your neighbor as local banker, barriers to affordable credit are significantly lowered. Village banking also creates a bond of trust in these farming communities between the organization and its users, ensuring decision-making starts at the community level. As a non-profit organization all profits of this partner go to extending new credit opportunities to these local banks and providing additional educational services such as computer classes. To further facilitate its agricultural clients FUDECOSUR often extends longer than average long terms, so that when a plague or heavy rains destroy the harvest, farmers have some flexibility in payment.\r\nRiding around in FUDECOSUR’s four wheel car over the past three months, I have interviewed over one hundred Kiva borrowers and visited nearly all of its 41 village banks. Since FUDECOSUR is a new Kiva partner and still in pilot phase a majority of my work has been spent on ensuring they are prepared to scale with a Kiva funding increase. The good news is, yes, I think we can expect to see a lot more Costa Rican borrowers on Kiva in the future. In addition to process refinement and borrower interviews, I have also compiled several Social Impact studies to measure FUDECOSUR’s success in their mission to alleviate poverty. The results have been heart-warming.\r\n\r\nRecently, Melvin, an entrepreneur in Santa Rosa de Brunca who took out a Kiva loan to purchase two cows, told me that he has really seen a difference in his community since FUDECOSUR came to town. The people have hope he says. Just by looking around he can see a difference. Houses are well kept and children go to school rather than work in their family’s fields. Melvin then wondered outloud if Kiva lenders would like to help his community finance a potable water system, which they are in the process of building.\r\n<strong>  Client Profile: Doña Maria and her pigs  :</strong>\r\nThe Executive Director of FUDECOSUR, Leonardo, often starts off his meetings with local village banks by telling the story of a butterfly farm. Imagine, he says, if at every birthday celebration, graduation, or religious ceremony if people let out butterflies! Wouldn’t it be beautiful? A room full of butterflies swirling about in the warm air to complement the happiness of the occasion? Butterflies of all colors, shapes, and sizes are abundant in Costa Rica but most importantly this kind of radical thinking exemplifies the utopian ideal we chase in micro-finance: new economic activity created where there once was none. So it is truly remarkable when such a case is found.\r\nDoña Maria is one of the spunkiest 76 year old women I have ever met. A few years ago Maria’s partner, who is 77, grew tired of trekking about in the hills of his coffee fields. The work is hard and at his age he didn’t feel like battling the mud, the rain, and the ant nests to pick the ripe red berries. So Doña Maria had the innovative idea to create something out of nothing. She decided to build a pig farm.\r\nMaria noticed that people in her village often travelled to the nearby town of Pejibeye to purchase their meat. Very few of her neighbors raised their own pigs and no butcher shop existed in her village. With a Kiva loan of $1,200 Doña Maria purchased six piglets and built a pig sty behind her house. Within six months from her loan date these pigs had already birthed 18 babies, a return of 300% on her original investment. If only my own investments showed such quick returns! Her neighbors quickly started placing bids for her pigs rather than travel all the way to neighboring town.

As you may know, all entrepreneurs on Kiva’s web site are supported by local Field Partners, or microfinance institutions (MFIs) like FUDECOSUR, who are Kiva’s liaison between Kiva lenders and Kiva borrowers. They choose which of their clients are eligible to receive Kiva support, write and upload business profiles, disburse loans, collect payments, write journal updates, and respond to lender comments. Currently, FUDECOSUR is one of three MFIs in Costa Rica and the only to focus exclusively on Costa Rica’s impoverished agricultural region.\n\nSouthern Costa Rica is ripe for Micro-Finance innovation. For a majority of FUDECOSUR’s clients their Kiva loan is the first loan they have ever received, and in some cases ever qualified for. Despite an abundance of national banking options and agricultural credit unions in the area most loan terms are too steep to afford and bank branches too difficult to reach over the muddy unpaved roads. FUDECOSUR specifically tailors its loans to serve this marginalized client base. By operating on a village banking model FUDECOSUR empowers local communities to manage their own credit resources. With your neighbor as local banker, barriers to affordable credit are significantly lowered. Village banking also creates a bond of trust in these farming communities between the organization and its users, ensuring decision-making starts at the community level. As a non-profit organization all profits of this partner go to extending new credit opportunities to these local banks and providing additional educational services such as computer classes. To further facilitate its agricultural clients FUDECOSUR often extends longer than average long terms, so that when a plague or heavy rains destroy the harvest, farmers have some flexibility in payment.\n\nRiding around in FUDECOSUR’s four wheel car over the past three months, I have interviewed over one hundred Kiva borrowers and visited nearly all of its 41 village banks. Since FUDECOSUR is a new Kiva partner and still in pilot phase a majority of my work has been spent on ensuring they are prepared to scale with a Kiva funding increase. The good news is, yes, I think we can expect to see a lot more Costa Rican borrowers on Kiva in the future. In addition to process refinement and borrower interviews, I have also compiled several Social Impact studies to measure FUDECOSUR’s success in their mission to alleviate poverty. The results have been heart-warming.\n\nRecently, Melvin, an entrepreneur in Santa Rosa de Brunca who took out a Kiva loan to purchase two cows, told me that he has really seen a difference in his community since FUDECOSUR came to town. The people have hope he says. Just by looking around he can see a difference. Houses are well kept and children go to school rather than work in their family’s fields. Melvin then wondered outloud if Kiva lenders would like to help his community finance a potable water system, which they are in the process of building.\n\n<strong>  Client Profile: Doña Maria and her pigs  :</strong>\n\nThe Executive Director of FUDECOSUR, Leonardo, often starts off his meetings with local village banks by telling the story of a butterfly farm. Imagine, he says, if at every birthday celebration, graduation, or religious ceremony if people let out butterflies! Wouldn’t it be beautiful? A room full of butterflies swirling about in the warm air to complement the happiness of the occasion? Butterflies of all colors, shapes, and sizes are abundant in Costa Rica but most importantly this kind of radical thinking exemplifies the utopian ideal we chase in micro-finance: new economic activity created where there once was none. So it is truly remarkable when such a case is found.\n\nDoña Maria is one of the spunkiest 76 year old women I have ever met. A few years ago Maria’s partner, who is 77, grew tired of trekking about in the hills of his coffee fields. The work is hard and at his age he didn’t feel like battling the mud, the rain, and the ant nests to pick the ripe red berries. So Doña Maria had the innovative idea to create something out of nothing. She decided to build a pig farm.\n\nMaria noticed that people in her village often travelled to the nearby town of Pejibeye to purchase their meat. Very few of her neighbors raised their own pigs and no butcher shop existed in her village. With a Kiva loan of $1,200 Doña Maria purchased six piglets and built a pig sty behind her house. Within six months from her loan date these pigs had already birthed 18 babies, a return of 300% on her original investment. If only my own investments showed such quick returns! Her neighbors quickly started placing bids for her pigs rather than travel all the way to neighboring town. By now Maria has a healthy business that help her and her partner earn a steady income without having to crawl around in the coffee fields. When Don Gerardo, a loan officer of FUDECOSUR, and I first met Maria she was out in knee high rubber boots and an umbrella feeding her pigs despite the heavy rains.

The good news is, yes, I think we can expect to see a lot more Costa Rican borrowers on Kiva in the future. In addition to process refinement and borrower interviews, I have also compiled several Social Impact studies to measure FUDECOSUR’s success in their mission to alleviate poverty. The results have been heart-warming.\r\n\r\nRecently, Melvin, an entrepreneur in Santa Rosa de Brunca who took out a Kiva loan to purchase two cows, told me that he has really seen a difference in his community since FUDECOSUR came to town. The people have hope he says. Just by looking around he can see a difference. Houses are well kept and children go to school rather than work in their family’s fields. Melvin then wondered outloud if Kiva lenders would like to help his community finance a potable water system, which they are in the process of building.\r\n<strong>  Client Profile: Doña Maria and her pigs  :</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe Executive Director of FUDECOSUR, Leonardo, often starts off his meetings with local village banks by telling the story of a butterfly farm. Imagine, he says, if at every birthday celebration, graduation, or religious ceremony if people let out butterflies! Wouldn’t it be beautiful? A room full of butterflies swirling about in the warm air to complement the happiness of the occasion? Butterflies of all colors, shapes, and sizes are abundant in Costa Rica but most importantly this kind of radical thinking exemplifies the utopian ideal we chase in micro-finance: new economic activity created where there once was none. So it is truly remarkable when such a case is found.\r\nDoña Maria is one of the spunkiest 76 year old women I have ever met. A few years ago Maria’s partner, who is 77, grew tired of trekking about in the hills of his coffee fields. The work is hard and at his age he didn’t feel like battling the mud, the rain, and the ant nests to pick the ripe red berries. So Doña Maria had the innovative idea to create something out of nothing. She decided to build a pig farm.\r\nMaria noticed that people in her village often travelled to the nearby town of Pejibeye to purchase their meat. Very few of her neighbors raised their own pigs and no butcher shop existed in her village. With a Kiva loan of $1,200 Doña Maria purchased six piglets and built a pig sty behind her house. Within six months from her loan date these pigs had already birthed 18 babies, a return of 300% on her original investment. If only my own investments showed such quick returns! Her neighbors quickly started placing bids for her pigs rather than travel all the way to neighboring town. By now Maria has a healthy business that help her and her partner earn a steady income without having to crawl around in the coffee fields. When Don Gerardo, a loan officer of FUDECOSUR, and I first met Maria she was out in knee high rubber boots and an umbrella feeding her pigs despite the heavy rains. Don Gerardo noted that he hopes he shows such initiative at that age. Who wouldn’t agree?\r\n\r\nDoña Maria’s case is only one of many example I have witnessed during my time in Southern Costa Rica. Despite popular opinion, most poor people work hard and when given an opportunity to improve themselves, they take it. Truly, the power of inclusive financial services like micro-credit is astonishing.\r\n<strong>The Rain in San Isidro:</strong>\r\nHere in southern Costa Rica the rainy season is in full swing. I think I’ve seen more rain in the past few months than I have in the past three years combined. It rains every day all day without fail and often hard enough to turn the street outside my tiny apartment in San Isidro into a full fledged river. Although it will be a relief to see some sunshine, I have to admit that I will miss the sound of rain clattering against my tin roof. The droning wash puts me to sleep at night and a warm metallic ping is my own natural alarm clock in the morning.\r\nDespite these miserable conditions the farmers of Costa Rica press on. Every day trucks loaded with bright red berries from the recent coffee harvest roll through town, leaving behind a syrupy scent that is unique to the area. It seems almost surreal that those beans will soon follow me overseas to be ground into a dark cup for my daily coffee. As I walk among the fierce skyscrappers of the Manhattan skyline I will be more thankful than ever for the sacrifices it took to get those beans there, for the farmers of the Brunca Region of Costa Rica to which I owe an unforgettable three months, and to you, the Kiva Lenders, who are making it all possible.\r\nOn behalf of myself and the entrepreneurs of the Brunca Region of Costa Rica thank you for being a Kiva Lender. Together, may we find sustainable solutions to poverty and facilitate development world-wide.', 'A letter from a Kiva fellow in Costa Rica', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '288-revision-4', '', '', '2012-10-31 20:08:35', '2012-10-31 20:08:35', '', 288, 'http://localhost:8888/2012/10/288-revision-4/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I have worked with them on a project lending my illustration services and am excited to work with them in the future. It’s easy to support a design team that designs for the good of the world. They invited me to share a bit about a project that I’m working on that is also for a good cause: Movember.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI just started a new job at Cisco Consumer Products – Flip Video as their graphic designer/ online merchandiser. We make Flip Video Cameras, and they have customizable faceplates, which is really useful when trying to send an important message. We have a section on our site called Flip for Good where a portion of proceeds supports a nonprofit or charity. This month we are featuring Movember.\r\n<strong>What is Movember?</strong>\r\nMovember is an annual charity event held during the month of November, where men grow a moustache to raise awareness and funds for cancers affecting men.\r\n<strong>Team Cisco</strong> is recruiting employees around the globe to join the effort and commit to growing a moustache for the month of November and raise money to fight cancer. The women of Cisco also participate by joining a team, donating to a team, wearing fake moustaches (optional), and talking about the event.\r\n<div></div>\r\n<strong>How Do I Donate Directly?</strong>\r\nClick here:\r\n<a href="http://us.movember.com/donate/your-details/member_id/599330/">http://us.movember.com/donate/your-details/member_id/599330/</a>\r\nand then fill out your information.\r\nWe will be posting regular updates of our Mo growing progress and funds raised on the Flip Video Facebook and Twitter pages and throughout the Cisco network.\r\n<strong>How do I buy a Stash-tastic Flip Camera and donate at the same time?</strong>\r\nBuy a custom Movember Flip video camera at <a href="http://www.theflip.com/movember">www.theflip.com/movember</a> which generates a $10 donation to the Movember foundation to fight cancer.\r\n<div><strong>Why get involved?</strong></div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>-A man is 35% more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than a woman is to be diagnosed with breast cancer.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>- A man will die from prostate cancer every 16.4 minutes- 32,000 men will die of the disease this year.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>- 1 in 6 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer- more than 218,000 cases of prostate cancer are expected to be diagnosed this year.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>- The men’s health movement is 30 years behind the women’s health movement.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div></div>', 'Movember!', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '293-revision-4', '', '', '2012-10-31 20:36:28', '2012-10-31 20:36:28', '', 293, 'http://localhost:8888/2012/10/293-revision-4/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Before I left MICA I was awarded the honor of "Excellence in Social Design." For many graphic designers, "Social Design" is a term that is used quite often without ever specifically being defined. We all know what we mean when we say "Social Designer," right? As I stood in MICA''s design department auditorium – receiving the kind words of my professors, a flower necklace, and a copy of Cradle to Cradle – I couldn''t help but wonder, "what exactly does it mean and what are its implications?"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBefore my senior year at MICA, I had the opportunity to work for John Bielenberg in Greensboro, Alabama. There, I co-directed the M Lab with my partner, Megan Deal. M Lab was the permanent manifestation of Project M, an annual month long workshop in which designers and other creatives apply their talents to "saving the world." Our job – which was never actually perfectly clear – involved being a youthful creative resource in a small rural town. I was optimistic, but struggled to imagine how graphic design could help.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter my first few months, I was approached by Tom Callos of the Ultimate Black Belt Test. He explained the UBBT; an annual group of karate black belt volunteers traveling to Greensboro to build a home for a resident in need. He then asked me to help them raise donations and awareness for their 2011 build. Finally, after months of trying to think of a "project" that could help Greensboro, reality had struck – people were already doing amazing things for the town and they needed graphic design. The website I built for Tom eventually raised over $16,000, and while obviously my website wasn''t the sole reason for those donations, it felt good to know that I had helped.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn December, my sixth month living, working, and cycling in Greensboro, a young man asked me and my friend, Dan Gavin, where we got our bikes. The idea for BikeLab suddenly hit me. Hale County – of which Greensboro is the county seat – is one of the poorest in the nation and many of its citizens lack access to transportation. Hale County also happens to have very little car traffic, is relatively flat, and spread out just enough to make walking impractical; basically, it is perfect for bicycling. With the advice of several other bicycle co-ops and Dan''s maintenance skills, we founded BikeLab as a non-profit under Hero Housing (a local housing resource center) to begin to address this issue. Within the next six months we had helped three local youths build their own bikes out of donated parts – admittedly a small impact, but a measurable one.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter M Lab, I re-enrolled at MICA to finish my senior year. REBU!LD, my thesis, began after a walk through West Baltimore. Surrounded on either side by abandoned rowhomes, I found myself on what seemed to be an entirely empty block. However, as I continued, I noticed a child on the opposite side of the street stop in front of one of the homes. I suddenly realized that he lived there, on a block that was otherwise completely vacant and crumbling. Soon after, I learned of "New East Baltimore," and came to find that the 88-acre redevelopment was not too different from the block I had visited in the west. However here, the causes for displacement were much more obvious. For four months, I documented the redevelopment, through audio interviews – with residents (current and former), development employees, and local activists – and photography.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNot that I thought it could directly help the boy or one in his position, REBU!LD took the form of a website and an installation. For the website, I compiled both my audio and photographs to create a narrative to tell the story of the redevelopment. For the installation, which took place within the development footprint, I wheatpasted large-format photographs onto the boarded façades of an entirely vacant block. The installation and subsequent opening was meant to celebrate the remaining community, invite people to see the footprint for themselves, and provide a poignant contrast to the crumbling buildings my photographs appeared on.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand it, any one of these projects could be considered "social design"; they typify criteria like working with ethical clientele and design entrepreneurship. However, I can''t help but wonder why such a distinction is necessary, why shouldn''t these criteria be implicit in every graphic designer''s practice? This is not to say that graphic design is devoid of such projects or that they are completely unique. I can happily say that work like this is becoming more and more common. The website I completed for the UBBT is an example of working with an ethical organization and was a chance to utilize my skill set to complement and augment their good work. Designers like Silas Munro, the design director at the non-profit Housing Works, exemplify this idea by working in a sector where graphic design can rarely be afforded. The founding of BikeLab and REBU!LD represent examples of design entrepreneurship; first-hand experience, research, and most importantly, multi-disciplinary collaboration made their success possible. BikeLab could easily have been a Brute Labs project, where ideas are founded on extensive research into social ills and then funded by generous donors (grants and awards). REBU!LD, though it may be harder to classify under this criterion, is not unlike the work of The Center for Urban Pedagogy where graphic design, utilizing research and collaboration, decodes our urban environment and solicits participation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBy labeling these kinds of efforts as part of an emerging field called "social design", one that increasingly requires a Master''s degree, do we risk deterring "non-social designers" from pursuing similar efforts? By lumping the diverse approaches by graphic designers, architects, artists, computer developers etc… towards social good into a single "job" are we fostering an oxymoronic profession; a specialized jack-of-all-trades? Furthermore, in a world where the "triple bottom line" is rightly gaining momentum and the "greater good" is recognized as the common good, could "social design" be an oversimplification for young creatives working towards a future that requires collaboration and optimism?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="Photo1" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bd5Nkd6WB2E/Tou_Kx6SOcI/AAAAAAAAAEo/G1206eoMcLI/s320/rlecluyse_ubbt.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="179" />\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="photo2" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rfFtVRsjan0/Tou_KmszGuI/AAAAAAAAAEg/xM0q1lqDgNM/s320/rlecluyse_rb.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="179" />\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="photo3" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dngY9suQrd8/Tou_KofjyLI/AAAAAAAAAEY/6_UdwZ5nbR8/s320/rlecluyse_in_2.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="212" />\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" title="photo5" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M74EcjcPONk/Tou_KUaAwcI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/sd8i_XcCesc/s1600/rlecluyse_in_1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="794" />', 'What is Social Design?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '196-revision-5', '', '', '2012-10-31 03:25:56', '2012-10-31 03:25:56', '', 196, 'http://localhost:8888/2012/10/196-revision-5/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Increasingly the news media, the government, and the entertainment industry, go to great lengths to make us all acutely aware of how awful everything is. Very rarely does anyone actually seem to provide concrete solutions for how to improve the situation of those most at risk, or that of humanity at large. It can be more than a bit overwhelming. Flashy movies and daunting statistics serve to either depress us, or temporarily ignite our desire to take action...only...we often don''t know what action to take and find our motivation displaced by a sense of helplessness.
